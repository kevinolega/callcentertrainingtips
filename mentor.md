A few years ago, I wrote a book on how to get hired in a call center.

Since then, I've helped thousands of people upgrade their life.

And in the process, I've helped thousands of people.

It's been over ten years since I started and I wanted to share the lessons that have helped me grow.

Call center work has been the stepping stone that has given me my dream life.

I believe it can do the same to you too.

So I'm creating a mentoring program.

But since there are over twenty thousand of you following my work, and I can't help you all at the same time, I decided to write all the lessons just like the first job hunting guide.

Read all these lessons first.

Then let's have a personal training session over the phone.

Or in person if you live nearby.

Just remember this.

I want you to succeed.

And I want you to be happy.

So here are the lessons in the right following format.

I put together the lessons in the following format.

Application, Training, Performance and Growth.

These will be the stages of your call center work.

I'll help you get a job.

I'll help you keep your job.

I'll help you perform really well and collect all that call center money.

Then I'll help you grow into the person that you are proud of.
