I put together two groups of computations.

The first group of computations is about how many sentences I can write if I wrote consistently for fifteen minutes a day over six weeks, one year, five years, up to twenty years.

I also computed what would happen if I wrote a little longer.

I put computations for 30 minutes, 60 minutes, all the way up to eight hours of writing a day.

This computation is useful to consider when you're trying to learn a skill, and you feel that your progress is too slow.

The answer is ALWAYS to stay consistent.

## The Phone Coaching is NOT the Most Important Element of Your Lessons

The most important part of the lessons is you forming the habit of putting your ideas on paper in English.

If you continue writing every day, even fifteen minutes a day can give you a LOT of progress.

This computation also shows you how much writing you can finish if you stayed a little longer.

The second group of computations shows you how much money I made as a new freelance writer.

If you developed your communication skills to level seven and you want to earn money from your writing skills, this is how much money I received when I was starting.

I converted the computations into short essays, so if you'd prefer just to review the spreadsheets and skip the explanation, you may visit the spreadsheet.

I'm posting a link here and at the end of this post for your reference.

## My First Month as a Freelance Writer

When I got hired as a writer, I made $1 for every 100 words that I've written.

Many of the articles that I've written are between 300 to 500 words.

I made $3 for a 300-word article.

I made $5 for a 500-word article.

I wrote at a speed of one sentence per minute.

I estimate that each sentence is approximately 3-5 words.

If I worked for one hour a day and completed one short article, I earned $3 that day.

I made an extra $60 that month.

If that's the only money I made that year, that's $720 at the end of the year.

$3 is worth Php 150.

$60 is worth Php 3,000.

$720 is Php 36,000.

If I kept my call center job, wrote for an hour a day, and saved the money that I earned writing short articles, I would have an additional Php 36,000 at the end of the year.

$18 is worth Php 900.

$360 is worth Php 18,000.

$2,160 is Php 216,000.

If I kept a less stressful part-time job that is close to home, and wrote for four hours a day, and saved the money that I earned writing short articles, I would have an additional Php 216,000 at the end of the year.


## My First Year as a Freelance Writer Part 2

Many of the articles that I've written are between 300 to 500 words.

I made $4.50 for a 300-word article.

This amount of money is more substantial than my call center income.

## My Second Year as a Freelance Writer Part 1

When I got more experience as a writer, I earned $2.50 for every 100 words that I've written.

Many of the articles that I've written are between 300 to 500 words.

Now and then, I write a 1,000 or 2,000-word article.

I made $7.50 for a 300-word article.

I made $12.50 for a 500-word article.

I made $25 for a 1,000-word article.

I made $50 for a 2,000-word article.

I wrote at a speed of one sentence per minute.

I estimate that each sentence is approximately 3-5 words.

If I worked for six hours a day and completed two longer articles, I earned $45 that day.

I made an extra $900 that month.

If that's the only money I made that year, that's $10,800 at the end of the year.

This amount of money is double my call center income.

At this point, I got a part-time job close to home watching a gym.


## My Second Year as a Freelance Writer Part 2

When I got more experience as a writer, I earned $2.50 for every 100 words that I've written.

Many of the articles that I've written are between 300 to 500 words.

Now and then, I write a 1,000 or 2,000-word article.

I made $7.50 for a 300-word article.

I made $12.50 for a 500-word article.

I made $25 for a 1,000-word article.

I made $50 for a 2,000-word article.

I wrote at a speed of one sentence per minute.

I estimate that each sentence is approximately 3-5 words.

If I focused on writing for eight hours a day and completed three longer articles, I earned $60 that day.

I made $1,200 that month.

If that's the only money I made that year, that's $14,400 at the end of the year.

$60 is worth Php 3,000.

$1,200 is worth Php 60,000.

$14,400 is Php 720,000.

I kept a less stressful part-time job that is close to home, where I had to sit at a booth and man the store.

I wrote for eight hours a day. 

When the store closed at night, I'd sit in a coffee shop to continue writing.

I'm happy I had enough money to pay for Starbucks.

I'm happy I've recovered some of the money that I used to buy my computer and pay for my internet connection.

I'm happy that the simple activity that I used to improve my life is now a source of income.

I know that more experienced writers earn more money.

I did not continue working as a professional writer at this point.

I worked a more stressful job as a virtual assistant and eventually worked as a project manager.

But that's for another story.

### EXTRA:

    (15*5*4)*0.7 = 210

    15 = minutes a day
    5 = words in a sentence
    4 = number to complete an hour
    0.7 = success rate. 30% of what I do is probably wrong and will be edited out.

Two hundred ten words per minute if I wrote a consistent one sentence per minute.

I should have computed this way.

    (60*5)*0.7 = 210

    60 = minutes
    5 = words in a sentence
    0.7 = success rate.

I'd get the same answer.

This exercise is a fun math activity to do, especially when you are worried about your future.
