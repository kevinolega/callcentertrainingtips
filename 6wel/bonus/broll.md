These websites inspired me to upgrade my life, do well at work and become a better writer and communicator.

I used to go to these websites regularly when I had free time.

I read something, try it out and profit from the lesson.

You're free to check these out.

Pay attention, you might learn something.

### LifeHacker

Lifehacker is a website that shares tools, tips and complete guides on how to upgrade your life.

I learned a lot about how to use technology to make my life better from LifeHacker.

My favorite LH writers are: Gina Trapani, Adam Pash, Adam Dachis, Thorin Kolsowski, Whitson Gordon and Stephanie Lee.

Many of the articles from 2010-2016 have been a big influence on how I upgraded my life.

The apps I use and many of the products that I bought are Lifehacker recommendations.

### ZenHabits

Zen Habits is written by Leo Babauta.

Leo is a native of Guam who became a professional blogger and eventually migrated to the US.

He used to be an overweight, unfit smoker and slowly made changes to improve his life.

Little by little, he became a fit, vegan, runner who works from home and enjoys ultralight travel.

I don't agree with everything that Leo promotes but I find his point of view interesting and many of his tips have helped improve my life.
