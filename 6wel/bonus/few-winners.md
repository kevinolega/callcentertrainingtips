Here's something to think about.

## 1% Success 99% Failure

INSURANCE STATISTIC

I worked for an insurance company and tried to sell their products.

Insurance companies are also known as Financial Institutions.

The people who work for insurance companies love to talk about money.

One of the things that they shared is a statistc about how much money people have when they get older.

They have been studying people for decades and the results are ALWAYS the same.

When you study the results of 100 people, when they reach age 65, here are the results.


54 don't have money for expenses.
36 don't reach age 65.
5 are working past retirement.
4 of 100 have some savings.
1 of 100 people are wealthy.

That's a statistic in the United States, the country almost every Filipino wants to live at.

Where do you want to be financially when you get older?

BUSINESS STATISTIC

According to different organizations who study the history of businesses, 96 of 100 business die off before they celebrate their 10'th aniversary.

20 out of 100 businesses die in the first year of operations.

30 more businesses fail in the second year.

50 more businesses die by the fifth year.

Out of 100, only 4 businesses make it past 10 years.

SALES STATISTIC

In sales, they taught us a sales funnel.

To make one sale:

162 phone conversations to schedule a meeting.
54 people said yes to meeting up with you.
27 people actually met up with you.
9 people who said yes yes they will buy.
3 people who promised to buy and signed a document.
1 person bought and paid. You have one sale!

To make one sale, but we're counting the rejections.

162 unanswered calls.
108 phone rejections.
27 canceled appointments.
18 people rejected you during or after the meeting.
6 people told you they'd buy but didn't sign any document or paperwork.
2 out of the three transactions didn't push through.

This is how we were taught in sales.

When I worked for tech support and we were expected to have sales, we were only required to sell to 1-2% of our calls.

That means I am going to get rejected 98 to 99% of the time.

And I should be fine with that. 

INTERVIEW STATISTIC

When I look for work, I always meet 16 prospective employers.

ONLINE FREELANCING

When I sell my services online, it takes me 20 poposals to get a five interviews that may land me a client.

Sometimes I have to send 40 proposals and get my interview at proposal number 36 and 38.

E COMMERCE STATISTIC

When selling online.

Only one out of 1,200 people who see our ads buy our lessons.

Only one out of 15 people message our ads.

LAW OF THE SEED

The law of the seed.

It takes 20 interviews to get a job.

It takes 50 meetings to make a sale.
