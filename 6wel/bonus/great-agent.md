Why should I hire you?

What are your strengths?

What are your advantages over the other applicants?

These questions, invite you to open up about your positive traits.

In the writing activities, I taught you that telling stories about your personal experience are the best way to answer questions like these.

I also gave you activities on how to put together the most important details and how to arrange the events of your stories.

Effective story telling is what I'd like to think as an UNBLOCKABLE move during the interview.

The interviewer will less likely debate you on your positive traits or make you go around in circles during a conversation because the story allows you to share the most important details about yourself without being interrupted.

If you complete the story-telling activities, you'll have moves that work on the interviewer.

Stories often connect your positive traits, weakness, achievements, failures and at the same time, assures the interviewer that you are human and you are dependable.

One question that I get asked often is, what postive traits should I highlight in my stories?

I have stengths and accomplishments that I'm proud of. 

I have lots of stories and experience to select from.

What do I open up with?

What top two stories should I polish?

To make the decision easier, what positive traits do I need to highlight?

Everyone is hard working.

Being dedicated to your job is difficult to quantify.

Telling the interviewer that you are talented will lead to a long discussion about nothing.

Telling somoene you have what it takes invites a debate.

Here are some postive traits that I feel is valuable.

### Disciplined

Work is not always 100% exciting.

There are parts that we like.

And there are parts that we don't like.

There are situations when the boss will tell us to work on something that we are not excited about.

A person who's creative may hate being told exatly what needs to be done.

A person who is obedient may hate being asked to come up with his or her own answers.

A shy person may hate having to talk to customers.

An extrovert may hate having to just do paperwork or written documentation.

You want to remember that you are being paid to work. 

You are expected to work on accomplishing tasks that move the company's goals forward.

Feelings don't often get a vote.

Prepare a story about doing tasks that you don't feel like doing.

Prepare a story about how you taught yourself good habits that the younger you hated doing.

### Punctual

90% of the people I met during training got fired from the call cente because of an attendance violation.

According to my trainer, the only reason why I won't get fired immediately is if I have perfect attendance.

I got several second chances because of my attendance.

I don't allow other people to interrupt me.

I say no to all of my invitations.

I make sure that I get enough sleep.

I guard my sleep schedule the same way as I guard my work day.

I am at work thirty minutes before the shift.

I always have enough money saved so I can call a taxi or a Grab to the office so I am never late.

If the jeep is taking too long and I see a cab, I take the cab.

My transportation budget allows me to call a cab to get to work on time.
