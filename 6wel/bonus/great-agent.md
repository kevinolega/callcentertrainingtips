Why should I hire you?

What are your strengths?

What are your advantages over the other applicants?

These questions, invite you to open up about your positive traits.

In the writing activities, I taught you that telling stories about your personal experience are the best way to answer these questions.

I also gave you activities on how to put together the most important details and how to arrange the events of your stories.

Effective story telling is what I'd like to think as an UNBLOCKABLE move during the interview.

The interviewer will less likely debate you on your positive traits or make you go around in circles during a conversation because the story allows you to share the most important details about yourself without being interrupted.

If you complete the story-telling activities, you'll have moves that work on the interviewer.

Stories often connect your positive traits, weakness, achievements, failures and at the same time, assures the interviewer that you are human and you are dependable.


One question that I get asked often is, what postive traits should I highlight in my stories?

I have stengths and accomplishments that I'm proud of. 

I have lots of stories and experience to select from.

What do I open up with?

What top two stories should I polish?

To make the decision easier, what positive traits do I need to highlight?

Everyone is hard working.

Dedicated is difficult to quantify.

Talented will lead to a long discussion about nothing.

Telling somoene you have what it takes invites a debate.
