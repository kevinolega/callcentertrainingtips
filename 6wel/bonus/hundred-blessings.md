Do you want to always have something to say during interviews?

Do you want to always be positive?

Do you want proof that you can win?

Do you want hard evidence that you can do it?

Do you want to discover details about yourself that you can confidently share with your interviewer?

Do you want to know the secret on how to make other people to like you?

Do you want to discover how to become more lucky, fortunate and blessed?

Here's an assignment.

Write down 100 blessings.

Just do it.

Don't stop until you reach one hundred.

Can't think of any?

Go through your FB friends.

Go through your photos.

Go around your home and start looking.

More importantly start writing.

Go.

Here's mine.
