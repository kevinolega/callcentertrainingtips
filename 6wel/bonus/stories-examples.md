You may have noticed that I shared a lot of my personal stories in each lesson.

These are my examples.

I make an effort to write how I want to speak.

How did I become more convincing when I speak?

I listened to a lot of stories shared by other people.

I developed the habit of asking people about their life stories.

When I started working at 18, I began asking people the story of how they ended up working at their job.

I asked people what their goals were.

I was curious about what their plans were and encouraged them to share strategies with me.

If the person I'm interviewing said something that I could relate to, I'd do my best to remember that.

Then I would write down the good ideas on my notebook.

Sometimes I would adapt good descriptions or good parts of the stories to my speech.

Every now and then, you'll find someone saying something that resonates with you so much.

I use the words, phrases, and sentences that made me smile or I found useful.

So when you read my stories, I encourage you to pay closer attention and find the words that you like.

I also want you to find the stories that you like and make it part of your writing.

Your communication skills are just a combination of introductions, questions, instructions, and stories.

Each category is composed of a few pages of sentences.

Each page is composed of sentences.

Each sentence is composed of words.

Your goal is to get your introductions, questions, instructions, and stories on paper.

One by one, inspect then replace the words and sentences that need to be improved.

Then keep repeating the process until you are happy with how you sound.

You're free to copy some of my words, phrases, and sentences.

The good news is you'll have me to help you edit.

Do your best to learn from the examples that I've shared so far.
