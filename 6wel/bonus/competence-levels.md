Illustration of competence levels.

Most people only have a binary judgment of a person's skill level.

You are either good or you're not.

Some people are more eloquent.

A person may be considered:

- Loser.
- Not very good or trying hard.
- Average good or okay.
- Godlike or sold his soul to the devil to be that good.

You can practice something once, fail and say you have zero skill.

You also know that you try enough times, you know that you can learn.

If you've ever watched anime, played video games, played a sport, learned how to cook, ride a bike, draw, sing, playing the guitar, gotten a girlfriend or applied yourself to learning any skill, you know what I'm talking about.

People get better as they try to learn a skill.

Learning a skill takes time and effort to practice.

99% of the failures will happen in the beginning.

If you want to learn how to cook, you'll get many cuts and burns.

If you want to learn how to play a sport, you'll stumble, get bruised and laughed at.

If you want to learn how to ride a bike, you'll fall off your bike and get scraped on the road.

If you want to learn how to play the guitar, your fingers are going to hurt and your neighbors are going to complain.

If you want to learn a martial art, you will get punched in the face and kicked in the balls.

If you want to learn how to get a girlfriend, you will get embarrassed and rejected.

The pain is all part of the game.

Whatever game you decide to play, you will experience suffering.

That's the bad news.

The good news is, if you keep going, you'll slowly climb to the different levels.

In a lot of skills, there are many levels.

Usually at least, 20 or 30.

More complicated skills have more levels.

But for illustration, I'm only showing you about ten.

Here are skill levels to consider.

### Can't do it (0%)

No matter how hard you try, you can't do it.

### Do it right once. (1%-4%)

You tried so many times and eventually you can do it right once but you haven't tried enough times to know if you can do it again.

### Do it right every now and then. (5-10%)

You tried more times and you've done it right more than once. You're just not too confident depending on this skill.

### Do it right once in a while. (11-15%)

Because of necessity, you've tried some more and you were able to do it right once in a while. The failure rate is pretty high so you avoid putting yourself on the spot.

### Do it right if you try but not all the time. (20%)

Since you learned how to do this skill, you've been put on the spot more times than you wanted to be. The failure rate is pretty high but after a few attempts, you can do it right.

### Do it right sometimes. (25%-30%)

Your success rate still isn't high and that's okay. You're just not as afraid as you were in the past stages. You know that if something doesn't work out you'll try again and it could work out.

### Do it right half the time. (50%)

You have some successes and some failures. You know it's normal. The failures no longer bother you as it did when you were new.

### Do it right most of the time but still miss every now and then. (70-80%)

You have more wins than losses. You may now consider yourself to be moderately good or average. You can accomplish tasks and whenever you fail, you know that you just need to make a small adjustment, try again and success!!!

### Do it right almost all the time. (85-95%)

You are about as good as the high level players. You have high success rate and low failure rate. You still fail, but nobody cares because you win more times than you lose.

### Does it all the time (96%)

Most top level players have reached this point. The only difference between the best and the person in the 4th, 5th and 6th place are 0.04% skill.

### Does it until never gets it wrong (97-99%)

It takes a lot of time and practice but this is what happens late in learning a skill. You can get to this point after spending a lot of time,  making a lot of mistakes and eventually matering this skill. 

### Does it perfectly (100%)

If you start early, follow good instructions, spend time and effort, you'll reach this point. For most of us, we never reach this point. 

And that's okay.

We only need to win a few times to achieve our primary goals and succeed.

## Activity:

How many attempts does it take to become really good at a skill?

How many failures do you need to face in order to become really good?

What is your current skill level?

Knowing the number of jumps you need to reach, will failing a few dozen times still bother you?

## Recap

There are different stages to learning a skill.

It's not limited to a yes or no answer.

You have to slowly climb your way up so you can learn, get better and eventually, you can use that skill to achieve your goals.

In a lot of cases, all you need is patience.

Just keep going, keep trying.

I've done this for a lot of skills and I know this works. 

If you do become more patient with yourself, and give yourself more chances, you're going to do it too.


### Easter Eggs

If you've ever played the first DoTA games, you'll recognize these items and their chance to do their special.

#### Cranium Basher:

- 25% chance to stun for 1.5 seconds and deal 100 bonus damage to melee heroes.
- 10% chance for ranged

#### Buriza Do Kyanon:

- 30% chance to deal 225% damage.

#### Monkey King Bar:

- 70% chance to pierce through evasion and deal 100 bonus magic damage.

I used to complain that the basher only had 25% chance to take effect but my friend told me to keep attacking and after 3-4 times, the basher will stun the target. All I had to do was keep attacking.

Thank you Karlo.
