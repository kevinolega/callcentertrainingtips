You can say no.

You are not required to say yes to all opportunities.

You are not required to attend all events.

You are not required to accept all invitations.

You are not required to listen to all sales offers.

You do not have the obligation to buy everything sold to you.

If you don't have the resources to pursue the opportunity, you can say no.

You do not have the obligation to help everyone you come across.

When you say no, life moves on for everyone involved.

The opportunity will be offered to someone else.

Everyone else will get on with their lives.

A no is a thousand times better than telling someone to wait for a decision.

A no is a thousand times better than a reluctant yes.

The habit of saying yes reluctantly has turned my life into a living hell.

It takes years of inconvenience to get out of commitments that you already said reluctantly said yes to.

There are other opportunities available.

If the job offer is lower than your target income, you can say no.

There are other opportunities available.

If you smell a bad deal, you can say no.

There are other opportunities available.

If you feel that you're getting an unfair deal, you can say no.

If you don't have the bandwidth to act, just say now.

It's not your problem.

It's never your problem.

Your life is your problem.

Life is not just one opportunity.

Life is a series of a lot of opportunities.

When you skip one, there will be another one when you are ready.

And because you are always making an effort to prepare, you can expect another opportunity.

Please remember, you can say no.

You can even share this page to say no to people.
