I put together this collection of recommendations to make it easier for you to go back to the old recommendations.

These lessons are important and I want you to go back to these lessons as many times as you need to because studying is not a one time event.

When you take cooking lessons, you practice until you can cook regularly.

When you take singing lessons, you practice until you can sing effortlessly.

When you learn martial arts, you practice until you can practice and defend yourself well. 

When you learn other skills, it is normal to keep going until you know how to do what you set out to learn.

In the same way, I want you to do the same.

When you read these lessons or do these activities, I want you to repeat the lessons or activities as needed.

I did.

In order for me to achieve my goals, I had to repeat something that I don't understand and do my research until I understand it.

If you Google something and you read a few pages of information about a topic, you don't know the topic.

I only consider myself to know the topic if I can use the skill without any problems.

Communication is a skill.

The better you are at communicating, the better you are at getting opportinities for better income.

Even in technical jobs, programers or IT staff who communicate well become managers.

I want you to sincerely consider what you are doing and make a genuine effort to improve.
