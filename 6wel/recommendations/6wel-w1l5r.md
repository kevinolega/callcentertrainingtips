Please read this multiple times and go back to your answers and make the needed changes.

#### Please be sure to apply the one-sentence paragraph format.

As the lesson said, a one-sentence paragraph means that instead of grouping multiple sentences together to form a long paragraph, you limit the size of the paragraph to a single sentence.

### THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE USUAL MULTI-SENTENCE PARAGRAPH

I'm Kevin Olega, the guy behind call center training tips. I work as a project manager and virtual assistant to various foreign entrepreneurs. I enjoy writing, creating websites, learning new things, and meeting new people in my free time. I'm from Paranaque City, and I worked mostly in the Makati and Ortigas area.

THIS IS NOT A ONE SENTENCE PARAGRAPH.

END OF THE ONE SENTENCE PARAGRAPH EXAMPLE.

### Pay Attention This is Important

The writing activity here is possibly the most crucial writing activity that you need to complete because these questions ALWAYS show up during interviews.

I have missed a lot of high paying job opportunities because I don't have a proper answer to these questions or have given incomplete answers during the interview.

### 100 Simple Sentences

Based on experience, the people who had the most trouble with this activity are the people who put many ideas in one sentence.

You should instead put your ideas in many sentences.

Just focus on writing 100 sentences about the topics, I asked you to write about.

The sentences don't have to be long and complicated.

Short, simple sentences will do.

Don't try to write long, complex sentences. 

Short sentences will do.

One of the biggest problems that I encounter is that long sentences pack more information than the reader can digest. 

Longer sentences are exhausting to write.

Longer sentences are also exhausting to read.

I recommend writing shorter sentences whenever possible.



### Your Greatest Accomplishment 

Your greatest accomplishment can be professional or personal. 

I have used stories about: 
going to the gym 
losing weight
building strength 
and martial arts 
I've used the above examples of accomplishments to tell my interviewers that I am disciplined, intelligent, hard-working, competitive, cooperative, and more.

A story about learning a new skill is my favorite story to share with the interviewer.

That's because learning a new skill requires focus and discipline.

Focus and discipline are traits that are required the most from new employees because they will undergo company and service training when they get hired.

You will also be expected to learn a dozen new skills in your first six months on the job.

Sharing a story about learning a skill gives your potential employer a picture of what it's like to hire you as a team member.

I'm sure you have the Filipino version of this story, and it's probably not very detailed.

I want you to write a detailed version of this in English.

If this task gets too complicated, write the Filipino version and summary of this along with the essential details that you want to include then make an effort to translate this into English.

### Your Greatest Weakness

The story of your greatest weakness is about a bad situation in your life that you turned into a positive event. 

Many of my weaknesses, disasters, and failures pushed me to become a better person. 

I have learned that as I got older, negative emotions are my common sense telling me that I  need to start a positive change. 

I recommend talking about every detail of your problems. 

Complain about it. 

Make a long list of disadvantages. 

Talk about the pain.

Because pain is relatable.

The biggest mistake job applicants make is they try to project an image that they're perfect.

They talk about strengths proudly and have no idea what their weakness is.

The impression I get when people don't give me an answer about their weakness is they are either incredibly stupid, lack self-awareness, or downright dishonest.

Yes, you are allowed to have weaknesses.

You just need to possess the attitude that you need to acknowledge your weakness and make an effort to improve yourself as a person.

The weakness can be overcome by having a plan and putting your plan to action.

You need to make attempts to improve yourself to overcome your weakness even if many of these attempts fail.

Weakness is not permanent.

A weakness can be a project.

A weakness can be something to work on.

A weakness is an opportunity.

You may have many weaknesses that prevent you from becoming a success.

The good news is, if you patiently work on overcoming the weakness, then you no longer have a reason to fail.

That's why you are taking lessons.

The objective is to find your weakness and spend time correcting them.

If you are allowed to have a weakness, you are also allowed strengths.

Whenever you overcome a weakness, you gain new strength.

That's just how it is.

One thing I learned is there are no small strengths and weaknesses.

Every small correction adds up over time.

If you've fixed dozens of small weaknesses, you'll become a competent and dependable person.

Spend half the time writing down possible solutions that you were considering then at the end, share what worked or why you are positive the solution will work.

Always finish your talk about weakness with a solution.

90% of the reason why employers hire employees is to solve a problem.

If you can prove to the employer that you can solve problems, then your chance of getting hired increases.

### Your Favorite Skill

The story of how you learned your favorite skill should give you an alternative answer to what are your strengths or why should I hire you question.

If you tell the interviewer about a time that you learned your favorite skill, you'll give your interviewer a preview on what it's like to teach you and assign a task to you.

Tell a story about a skill that you are proud of.

Tell a story about what it's like to NOT have that skill.

Tell a story about how you found yourself in a situation where you HAD to learn that skill.

Tell a story about your journey and struggle to learn this skill.

Share the steps that you took to learn the skill.

Tell a story about the mistakes that you made.

Tell a story of your breakthrough when you finally learned the skill.

Tell a story about how you eventually became proficient with the skill.

Tell the story about the benefits of learning the skill.

### Give Clear Instructions That People Can Follow

Instructions on how to use your favorite skill are designed to test how well you give instructions. 

The more detailed you are, the better. 

Give a short intro about what the instructions are and why it's important.

Start with a summary then give a detailed step by step instructions.

Examples include:

How to commute from your house to the office.

How to cook your favorite meal.

How to form a good habit.

How to quit a bad habit.

How to solve a problem.


These questions always show up during call center interviews.

#### How did you get here from your home?

Instructions on how to commute from your house to the location of the call center office that you have an interview is a simple question, but it gets asked all the time.

#### Expect a Random Problem During Interviews

Instructions on how to solve a problem get asked all the time.

#### Why Call Center?

Share the story of why you wanted to work in a call center. 

Share what other options (non-call center) you have and why you don't want to work there.

I took a medical course, but it is difficult for me to find a job. Many of my peers who are employed are having a difficult time because the pay isn't as high as we want it to be.

I took up business administration, and my career path is getting a job that involves office work. Still, I realized that many local companies don't really play very well.

I didn't finish college, and many of my friends worked in different low-paying jobs like a fast food attendant, mall clerks, cashiers, and the like. I realized that I don't want to work there.

Talk about the benefits of working in a call center.

Talk about how the money will change your life.

Talk about what you plan to buy.

Talk about how you can help yourself.

Talk about how you can help your family.

Talk about what skills you're going to study.

### Personal and Professional Goals

â€¢ What is your dream income, and what's your plan to reach your dream income? 

This doesn't get explicitly asked during the interview, but having a proper answer to this question can mean the difference between a career and financial success and disaster.

The more detailed your answers are here, the more confident you will be when it comes to answering follow up questions and salary negotiation questions.

Managers and business owners want to hire a person with ambition and a plan for a good future.

If you have no ambition or low ambition, they don't see you as the kind of person who will strive to perform well and make a contribution to their company through your job.

In other words, investing in you is a waste of money, and interviewing you is a waste of time.

Keep this in mind and spend some time writing a plan for how you are going to improve your life and connecting how you will connect doing your best at the job to achieving the kind of life that you want to build.
