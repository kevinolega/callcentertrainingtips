Here are some recommendations on how to maximize what you learned for lesson 3.

Please read this multiple times and go back to your answers and make the needed changes.

### Collect Ideas

I want you to begin writing your ideas in your notebook every day.

### Write Daily

Writing in your notebook should be a daily habit.

### Journalling Triggers Mastery

If you want to get better at any skill, you need this habit to make the most amount of progress.

Write down what you did today.

Write down improvements you've observed.

Write down things that didn't work out well.

Write down ideas on how to do better next time.

### Collect Valuable Questions

Make it a habit to write down and collect your questions on your notebook so we have more things to discuss during the phone coaching.

### Revisit Your Questions

Many important questions require that you make an effort to answer multiple times.

The first answer is usually a reflex answer, based on something that you know in the past.

The second answer is usually combined with new information, so you’re just repeating what you learned.

The third answer is usually something you thought of but may be combined with an untested idea.

The fourth answer is usually something that you’ve given enough thought and the answer is more reliable.

The fifth answer is a more refined version of the fourth answer.

The sixth answer is usually delivered more confidently because you already tested and carefully thought about your ideas.

You want to give yourself more opportunities to give a good answer.

I am a slow thinker so it takes me a while to put together a good answer.

If you're not super intelligent or fast at composing your thoughts, then the strategy of combining and updating your answers help.

### My Writing Process

Based on experience, I write things down on my notebook, I encode the ideas on my computer, I read everything aloud, I edit and add in additional details based on how my writing sounds.

### Mistakes are Normal

It's okay to make mistakes. 

It's not okay to keep repeating the same mistakes. 

During the phone coaching session, please write down your errors on your notebook so you can collect your errors and fix them one by one.

If you spend your time fixing your errors, your mistakes won’t be a problem in the future.

If you decide to ignore your mistakes, then you risk repeating your errors over and over again.

Mistakes costs opportunities.

If you invest some time fixing your mistakes, you'll have a better outcome in everything you attempt.

Small errors repeated over time can cause a lifetime of failure.

A few good habits, accumulated over time can give you a life of success.

The problem is the habits of failures are often fun and entertaining.

The habits of success are often easy but boring.

You have to choose between temporary pleasure over permanent success.

### Success Requires Effort

Don't be tempted by shortcuts and laziness. 

This is exactly how people scam you and steal your money and your time. 

The long method is the true short method.

Get better so you have true better results. 

Some people flex fast result but that's not true. 

Fast results are often just people trying to trick you into buying what they are selling.

I've been working for over fifteen years, hard work is the reason why only 1% of the performers are at the top. 

The final question is, are you working in a way that you're worthy of the title "top performer"?

### The Obstacle is the Way

Writing down your obstacles helps you create good plans to make your life better. 

Be as specific as possible. 

Answer the questions, who, what and where so you know exactly what to avoid.

### To Do List

Writing down your tasks enable you to have a clear picture of what you need to do. 

Always ask yourself, what is the next step for this task and write your answer down. 

### Keep Goals Secret

Instead of attempting to convince people to support you, it is better to write down both your goals and the plans that you are considering and talk to people who will give you good advice.

Negative feedback is often extremely discouraging. 

I have talked to people who were stuck for decades because they kept listening to a negative parent or family member.

Please be quiet about your goals.

Put your goals on paper instead.

I want you to have a notebook that you can read for encouragement.

You want to have a reminder that you are working on building a better future.

Sometimes you have to have faith that it will happen.

The best way is to plant your ideas in your notebooks.

Slowly but surely, you can watch your ideas grow and you can develop the power so you can help yourself build your dream life.

As I did mine.

Go back to your notebook and continue writing.
