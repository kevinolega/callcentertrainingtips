- Sunday (5pm-9pm)

## Start Date

The training materials will be sent to your email address.

We send out our lessons at 9 am.

If you do not receive an email on the first day, please send us a message so we can check.

In many situations, the email can be found in the SPAM folder so please check there too.

## Purpose of the Training

We provide our students with a safe space to practice their English with a dedicated instructor through writing activities and one to one phone coaching.

We deliver lessons via email and phone coaching to make the learning experience affordable and convenient for both the student and the instructor.

## Training Materials

Please read the emails carefully and download the PDF to your phone or computer.

Our goal is to help you develop your ability to express yourself in English comfortably and confidently.

We begin with opening up topics about yourself and slowly transition to more professional and work related conversations.

## Please do all the writing activities.

In order to improve your speaking ability, we need to evaluate the quality of the words that you use through the writing activities. 

Please purchase two notebooks because you will be doing a lot of writing.

Purchase more notebooks as you require.

Done correctly, we expect you to complete anywhere from 200 to 800 pages of writing at the end of the six week period.

## Call For Help

If you have any questions or you’re experiencing any difficulty, please send me a message and we will assist you.

If a link doesn't work or you can't access a lesson, please let me know so we can fix it.

## Certificate of Completion

We can provide a certificate of completion upon completion of all 42 lessons at your request.

We can also provide letters of recommendations and resume building assistance at a minimal cost.

## Non Refundable

The tuition is non-refundable.

## Freeze Policy

If for any reason, you need more time to finish the lessons or reschedule your phone coaching for an indefinite period, please let us know.

We did specify a six week period for the lessons however we would prefer to not implement a finished or not finished policy.

If you need more time, we will give you more time.

That being said, if you have an emergency, a conflict with your schedule or any other commitment that will prevent you from continuing the lessons, please inform us so we can freeze your account.

## Continue After Long Breaks

To continue the lessons, you only need to send us a message and we will continue where you left off.

We keep a record of your info so you never have to worry that we'll forget about you.

## Daily Email Lessons and Activities

Building English skills, like any skill, requires daily practice and study.

To improve the quality of the words that you use, we are doing writing activities to evaluate your existing vocabulary and grammar as well as your comprehension.

Instead of grading you as passed or failed, we will give you the opportunity to try again.

We would provide you with feedback on how to answer better and simply ask you to repeat the activity with your new knowledge.

Please repeat all the activities that you need to repeat.

## 42 Lessons and Activities

Unless you make your living as a professional writer, we expect everyone to take their time to write complete answers instead of trying to finish the lessons as quickly as possible.

### Shorten Your Writing Sessions

If you don't have the time to write, shorten your writing sessions.

If a lesson is challenging or difficult, focus on answering just one question at a time.

Some questions require a full day to come up with a good answer and that is okay.

### List Your Ideas

If you can’t think of an answer, I found it helpful making a list of ten possible answers and combining my ideas to create a good answer.

### Read Your Answers Aloud

Reading the lessons aloud as well as your answers multiple times is good practice.

### Listen to Yourself

Recording your voice as you read your answers and listening is not required but extremely helpful for independent learners.

### Repeating and Rewriting

It’s always a good idea to rewrite your answer to a question whenever you have a better answer ready.

Repeating and rewriting is a failure's greatest fear.

At the same time, repeating and rewriting is a master's shortcut.

### Sincerely Study and Review

Make it a habit to review a lesson, and review your answers.

There is no reading material that's so good that you only have to read it once and you're done.

Leaders are readers.

Even religious leaders read and study their Bible every day.

Lawyers and doctors review their legal and medical books and case files on a regular basis.

Studying is something you can't escape. 

And the people who believe that they can escape studying usually fall into worse situations.

Avoiding studying is like running away from your teacher's punishment by hiding inside a burning building.

### Don't Quit

To complete this program, you are only required to read the training materials, answer the questions and send in your answers.

We will read your answers, tell you what's wrong, teach you how to fix the problems and discuss during your phone coaching.

That's it.

It's only six weeks.

If you can't finish six weeks of writing, emailing and talking on the phone, what makes you think you can talk to sixty to one hundred Americans a day eight hours a day? 

What makes you think you can succeed learning more difficult and complex tasks like running a business?

### Don't take shortcuts

The shortcut is the long cut.

Don't try to avoid the work.

Don't make yourself a failure simply because you lost to laziness.

Remember this:

If you take shortcuts, you don't deserve success.

To deserve success, you have to reject shortcuts.

## Call Center Interview Questions

We have students who are professionals in the education, IT, medical and business field.

We understand that not everyone who enrolls is not interested in working for a Call Center or BPO and that's perfectly fine.

You still need to answer the interview questions.

Instead of pretending that you want to work in a call center, you can cross out the "call center" from these questions and insert your dream or target job instead.

**For example:**

What are the advantages of working in a call center?

This question then gets changed to:

What are the advantages of working in the IT department?

What are the advantages of owning a business.

Many of the questions apply to interviews in your field as well as work related conversations.

The main goal is to get you comfortable in expressing yourself.

## Submitting Your Answers

If you have access to a computer, you may type in your answers and email it back to us.

You can send your answers directly from the email, as MS Word, Apple Pages, Google Documents, PDF, RTF and .txt files.

Please remember to label your activity in the subject line of your email.

For example: Activities for Week 05: Lesson 3 and include the title of the lesson.

## Copy The Questions

Please copy the questions when you send in your answers.

## Please keep your paragraph size to one or two sentences.

It is painful to read a big block of text.

Big blocks of compressed text is also incredibly difficult to correct.

Please add a space above and below each line to make it easier to add corrections and feedback.

## Submitting Your Scanned Answers

Most of our students don't have a laptop or access to a computer.

After they receive the emails, they answer the questions on their notebook, snap a photo of their answers and forward the scans back to our email address.

**Some reminders:**

## Please write legibly.

Based on personal experience, I found out that increasing the size of my handwriting to two lines or more had helped increase my confidence.

## Please keep your paragraph size to one or two sentences.

It is painful to read a big block of text.

Big blocks of compressed text is also incredibly difficult to correct.

Please add a space above and below each line to make it easier to add corrections and feedback.

## Using Your Phone to Scan and Send Your Answers

Please remember to include page titles and page numbers as well as part numbers (if needed) to the page before a scan to make it easier to review.

Please use a scanner app from Google Drive or Google Keep for Android phones.

If you are using an iPhone, the notes app has a built in scanner feature inside the app.

When doing the scan, please do so in a well lit room and/or in the morning.

Please avoid using pencils, colored pens or shiny ink as it may not be readable during the scan.

Please check for readability or faded scans before sending.

If the photo is more readable than the scan, please send in the photo instead.

## Modules and Lessons

You need to complete your answers and we need to check your answers before proceeding to the next module.

We are committed to helping our students have a smooth experience with upgrading their English skills.

We have found it beneficial to avoid giving the student information overload or overwhelming the student with many activities.

We will be sending lessons 1 to 7 first.

After we received all seven activities, we will check and ask the student to answer any incomplete activities before sending the next set of lessons.

We will ONLY send you the next batch of activities after we have confirmed that you have completed the current week of activities.

## Phone Coaching Rules

### Save Your Questions

Whenever a question pops into your head, please write that on your notebook so I will be able to discuss that with you during the phone coaching.

### Complete Your Written Activities

We need the activities to evaluate your performance and as the main point of reference for the phone coaching.

### Inform Us of Your Availability

On the day of your phone coaching, please send me a text just to let me know when you are ready.

Please inform us of any reschedule requests.

### My Coaching Phone Number

Please send a text to 09178952637 for Globe or 09190078440 for Smart.

If you miss phone coaching, please send us a message with three options of your next available time and we will check our schedule if we can accommodate you. If we are not available, the session continues on your next schedule.
