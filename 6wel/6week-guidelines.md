Current open schedule for phone coaching are:

- Saturday (10am-10pm)
- Sunday (5pm-9pm)

### Start Date

The training materials will be sent to your email address.

We send out our lessons at 9 am.

If you do not receive an email on the first day, please send us a message so we can check.

In many situations, the email can be found in the SPAM folder so please check there too.

### Purpose of the Training

We provide our students with a safe space to practice their English with a dedicated instructor through writing activities and one to one phone coaching.

We deliver lessons via email and phone coaching to make the learning experience affordable and convenient for both the student and the instructor.

### Training Materials

Please read the emails carefully and download the PDF to your phone or computer.

Our goal is to help you develop your ability to express yourself in English comfortably and confidently.

We begin with opening up topics about yourself and slowly transition to more professional and work related conversations.

### Please do all the writing activities.

In order to improve your speaking ability, we need to evaluate the quality of the words that you use through the writing activities. 

Please purchase two notebooks because you will be doing a lot of writing.

Purchase more notebooks as you require.

Done correctly, we expect you to complete anywhere from 200 to 800 pages of writing at the end of the six week period.

### Call For Help

If you have any questions or you’re experiencing any difficulty, please send me a message and we will assist you.

### Certificate of Completion

We can provide a certificate of completion upon completion of all 42 lessons at your request.

We can also provide letters of recommendations and resume building assistance at a minimal cost.

### Non Refundable

The tuition is non-refundable.

### Freeze Policy

If for any reason, you need more time to finish the lessons or reschedule your phone coaching for an indefinite period, please let us know.

We did specify a six week period for the lessons however we would prefer to not implement a finished or not finished policy.

If you need more time, we will give you more time.

That being said, if you have an emergency, a conflict with your schedule or any other commitment that will prevent you from continuing the lessons, please inform us so we can freeze your account.

To continue the lessons, you only need to send us a message and we will continue where you left off.

We keep a record of your info so you never have to worry that we'll forget about you.

### Daily Email Lessons and Activities

Building English skills, like any skill, requires daily practice and study.

To improve the quality of the words that you use, we are doing writing activities to evaluate your existing vocabulary and grammar as well as your comprehension.

Instead of grading you as passed or failed, we will give you the opportunity to try again.

We would provide you with feedback on how to answer better and simply ask you to repeat the activity with your new knowledge.

Please repeat all the activities that you need to repeat.

### 42 Lessons and Activities

Unless you make your living as a professional writer, we expect everyone to take their time to write complete answers instead of trying to finish the lessons as quickly as possible.

If a lesson is challenging or difficult, focus on answering just one question at a time.

Some questions require a full day to come up with a good answer and that is okay.

If you can’t think of an answer, I found it helpful making a list of ten possible answers and combining my ideas to create a good answer.

Reading the lessons aloud as well as your answers multiple times is good practice.

Recording your voice as you read your answers and listening is not required but extremely helpful for independent learners.

It’s always a good idea to rewrite your answer to a question whenever you have a better answer ready.

### Call Center Questions

We understand that not everyone who enrolls is not interested in working for a Call Center or BPO and that's perfectly fine.

You still need to answer the interview questions.

Instead of pretending that you want to work in a call center, you can cross out the "call center" from these questions and insert your dream or target job instead.

For example:

What are the advantages of working in a call center?

This question then gets changed to:

What are the advantages of working in the IT department?

What are the advantages of owning a business.

### Submitting Your Answers

If you have access to a computer, you may type in your answers and email it back to us.

You can send your answers directly from the email, as MS Word, Apple Pages, Google Documents, PDF, RTF and .txt files.

Please remember to label your activity in the subject line of your email.

For example: Activities for Week 05: Lesson 3 and include the title of the lesson.

### Please keep your paragraph size to one or two sentences.

It is painful to read a big block of text.

Big blocks of compressed text is also incredibly difficult to correct.

Please add a space above and below each line to make it easier to add corrections and feedback.

Submitting Your Scanned Answers

Most of our students don't have a laptop or access to a computer.

After they receive the emails, they answer the questions on their notebook, snap a photo of their answers and forward the scans back to our email address.

Some reminders:

Please write legibly.

Based on personal experience, I found out that increasing the size of my handwriting to two lines or more had helped increase my confidence.

Please keep your paragraph size to one or two sentences.

It is painful to read a big block of text.

Big blocks of compressed text is also incredibly difficult to correct.

Please add a space above and below each line to make it easier to add corrections and feedback.

Please remember to include page titles and page numbers as well as part numbers (if needed) to the page before a scan to make it easier to review.

Please use a scanner app from Google Drive or Google Keep for Android phones.

If you are using an iPhone, the notes app has a built in scanner app.

When doing the scan, please do so in a well lit room and/or in the morning.

Please avoid using pencils, colored pens or shiny ink as it may not be readable during the scan.

Please check for readability or faded scans before sending.

If the photo is more readable than the scan, please send in the photo instead.

Modules

You need to complete your answers and we need to check your answers before proceeding to the next module.

We are committed to helping our students have a smooth experience with upgrading their English skills.

We have found it beneficial to avoid giving the student information overload or overwhelming the student with many activities.

We will be sending lessons 1-7 first.

After we received all seven activities, we will check and ask the student to answer any incomplete activities before sending the next set of lessons.

Phone Coaching Rules

Whenever a question pops into your head, please write that on your notebook so I will be able to discuss that with you during the phone coaching.

We need the activities to evaluate your performance and as the main point of reference for the phone coaching.

On the day of your phone coaching, please send me a text just to let me know when you are ready.

Please inform us of any reschedule requests.

Please send a text to 09178952637 for Globe or 09190078440 for smart.

If you miss phone coaching, please send us a message with three options of your next available time and we will check our schedule if we can accommodate you. If we are not available, the session continues on your next schedule.

Have Fun

Please be sure to not take any of the activities too seriously and have fun.
