Here are some additional recommendations so you can get the maximum benefit from Lesson 2.

Please read this multiple times and go back to your answers and make the needed changes.

## Always Take Notes

Make it a practice to write down everything that you learned so it will stay with you.

## Focus on Solutions

Don't focus on the problem.

Focus on the solution.

Avoid saying that you are not good in English. 

You are learning to improve your English by practicing everyday. 

You are writing regularly and looking for opportunities to speak with an English speaker.

## Your Answers Can Evolve

Don't just read once and answer once.

Read your answer again.

How does it sound?

Are you happy?

### Ask yourself the following questions

How can I make my answer more specific?

How can I communicate this better?

What words can I simplify?

What sentences can I shorten?

What ideas can I separate into multiple sentences?

What ideas can I elaborate?

What other details can I improve?

Do your best to be specific to improve your answers. 

Avoid one word answers and short phrases.

### Write Longer Answers

During practice mode, you want to make your answers as long as possible.

During your interview, you want to select your best answers for the interviewer.

When your interviewer hears something interesting, they will ask you to elaborate and explain your answer.

If you don't have the full English version of your story or instruction, you are not going to deliver your answer well.

Translating your answers from Filipino to English during the interview doesn't result in clear or confident communication.

Then you'll fail the interview.

The interviewer will use "poor communication skills" as the reason they rejected you.

### Avoid Opening with Positive Traits

It is extremely tempting to answer many interview questions with your positive traits, but we discovered that stories are the best answers to these questions. 

Back when I was interviewing for our company, whenever an applicant answers with a positive trait, we are instructed to ask follow up questions to make sure that the applicant is telling the truth about their positive trait.
	
For Example:

#### Dedicated

We ask them to share a story about a time you had to choose work over personal commitments.

#### Hard working

We ask them to share a story about your longest overtime.

#### Reliable

We ask them to share a story about what you do to avoid work related mistakes.

#### Flexible

We ask them to share a story about a time that you had to do work that is not related to your job description.

#### Strong work ethic

We ask them to a tell a story about a time where you were supposed to do a task that you personally don't feel like doing.

#### Ambitious

We ask them to share what your personal and professional goals are and what is the story behind your goals?

#### Loyal

We ask them to share a story about how you quit your last three jobs.

#### Disciplined

We ask them to share and describe your day to day routine and how you manage your time and tasks.

There are more.

The idea is if you open with a positive trait, the natural response is to put you in a spot to prove that you really have the positive trait.

HR and Recruitment professionals are often psychology graduates so they have training to spot job applicants giving fake answers.

The reason why I gave you a lot to write is so you can speak comfortably and confidently because you have excellent product knowledge about yourself. 

### Stories Communicate Positive Traits

After writing dozens of stories to prepare or my job application, I discovered that my strengths, weakness, stories and skills are all connected.

Every skill that I'm good at, is often connected to a past weakness.

#### I'm the hero of my story

The story is simply the journey from the time I discovered my weakness to the time that I developed my strength.

This is very much like the story of many comic book superheroes.

Tony Stak was captured by terrorists and forced to build a weapon instead of building a missile, he built a suit of armor to escape that he later used to fight bad guys as Ironman.

Bruce Wayne lost his parents when he was a kid, he studied to become the world's greatest detective, martial artist and athlete to fight crime.

Bruce Banner almost died in a science experiment and he got exposed to radiation, this transformed him into the incredible Hulk.

Matt Murdock lost his sight in a freak accident. His other senses got sharper and he was later trained by a blind master martial artist. He fights criminals as Daredevil.

The events that gives us scars also gives us superpowers.

#### My Weakness Gave Me Powers

Sometimes, the process happens in this order.

I'm trying to accomplish a goal. 

I fail miserably. 

I discovered a skill that I need to learn.

I suck at the skill.

I keep going.

I feel discouraged.

I get a little better.

I make a huge mistake.

I stand up again.

I fail again.

In time, I master the skill.

Eventually, I achieve my goal.

#### We all relate to the same story

When I read the story aloud to myself, I discover my positive traits and I write those details down in my notebook.

When I tell the same story to the interviewer, I never have to discuss my positive traits.

The interviewer then know my positive traits, even without me telling them.

The interviewer sometimes tells me what my positive traits for me.

When that happens, I know I passed the interview.

#### I know my positive traits, but not the story...

In some situations, you know you have specific positive traits.

Your problem is you don't have the words to communicate it.

That's okay. 

Here's what to do:

Go write a list of your positive traits.

Make a list of goals or tasks that you have you accomplished because of your positive trait.

Make a list of skills that you have acquired because of the positive trait.

Make an effort to recall the story that's connected to your positive trait.

Write down the summary of that story.

Make an effort to remember your weakness, before you had the positive trait.

Write down your weakness.

Arrange the details starting with the weakness, the journey, the skill, the goal you accomplished.

Whenever I write this, I make a list of positive traits that I have, then connect it to a story.

Sometimes, I make a list of negative traits, connect it to a story, then connect it to a positive trait that I have unlocked.

### Share a story about why you make a good person to hire.

Make a list of positive traits for professionals that apply to call center work.

Here are some examples:

A call center agent is expected to never get angry at the customer.

A call center agent is expected to work nights, on weekends, holidays, and is never late or absent even on shifting schedules.

A call center agent is expected to be disciplined, obedient, customer service focused.

An effective call center agent self-studies, does research, and never depends on just their team leader for instructions and updates.

Make a list of positive traits for call center workers.

At the top of my head, here are some examples:

If you work in customer service, you have to be patient and organized.

If you work in tech support, you have to be knowledgeable, detail oriented.

If you work in sales, you have to be goal oriented and persistent.

Select a positive trait that you want to highlight. 

Without directly saying what the positive trait is, write down a story that tells the listener that you have the positive trait. 

A story needs to have a beginning, middle and an end. 

The story needs to end with the listener saying that you have the positive trait without directly telling them exactly what the positive trait is.

Here are some examples:

#### Kevin is consistently getting better.

Whenever an interviewer asks me what my greatest strength is, I have difficulty giving a consistent answer. 

Many of my current strengths are a weakness from a few months or years ago. 

I spend a lot of my free time writing down ideas in my notebook. 

I usually write down things that I learned, and how to improve myself. 

I also list down failures, mistakes and bad habits. 

When I feel positive or feel that I need to change, I solve a lot of my problems on paper. 

I come up with a plan and do the smallest thing that I can begin with immediately. 

After suffering through more painful mistakes, I begin to figure out exactly what works and eventually, I mastered the new skill.

#### Kevin is persistent in learning to become excellent.

My boss once told me that in the beginning, he had a difficult time teaching me. 

I had a lot of questions, and I learned many of the tasks that I was assigned by doing them. 

The thing about that is, I also made a lot of embarrassing mistakes. 

He did tell me that he appreciates that I learned from my mistakes and did not give up despite the fact that he can see in my face that I am extremely discouraged by my poor performance and ready to give up. 

Little by little, I did learn from my mistakes, and eventually, I was doing all the assigned tasks smoothly and after some time no longer required direct supervision from him.

#### Avoid Unprofessional Speech

Avoid giving the following answers:

	- All of the above.
	- I'll accept any option (kahit ano)
	- Reflecting the question back to the interviewer. You decide for me.
	- Vague answers.

### Give Great Instructions

Complete all step by step instructions with as many details that you can include. 

Read your answer aloud. 

Imagine someone else will reading the instructions you have written.

Imagine using the instructions you have written to teach someone over the phone. 

#### Ask yourself

Are my instructions sufficient that a grade school student will be able complete the task after the instructions were relayed over the phone?

As always, let me know about your questions.
