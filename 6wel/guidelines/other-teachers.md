When you enroll, please focus on completing the activities.

I understand that you are excited.

It may have already crossed your mind to read other books or watch other YouTube channels.

Please don't.

If you have too many teachers, you will end up being confused by the lessons.

In a lot of situations, my lessons are the opposite of popular call center advice on YouTube.

Many Filipino YouTubers are focused on creating entertaining content.

That explains why many of these videos contain useless effects and jumpcuts and EatBulaga style sound effects.

Many online job hunting advice is focused on giving you tricks.

I am focused on giving you skills.

There's a big difference.

YouTubers are focused on getting views and watch time, that's why their content is long, but they don't teach you many valuable lessons.

I am giving you the solution that I used to solve my own problems.

The modules that I created for you is intended originally for a shy person who doesn't have communication skills.

I sincerely want you to win.

I enjoy reading the stories of people who got hired after listening to my advice.

I don't want you to be distracted.

Please don't listen to other instructors.

Please avoid reading other lessons.
