This is a guide on how to organize your answers.

Please remember that developing your ability to organize your thoughts and submit organized answers is also a critical factor in the hiring process.

People who are organized are given more opportunities than people who are not organized.

Knowing how to organize is an important skill to develop whenever possible.

This is your opportunity to practice.

## Label Your Activities.

Please remember to label your activity in the subject line of your email.

Example Subject Line: 

    Activities for Week 05: Lesson 3 and include the title of the lesson.

Example File Name:

	Week 04: Activity 2 - Call Center Math - Ralph Reyes.pdf

Labelling is a key call center skill.

## File Formats

You can send your answers directly from the email, as MS Word, Apple Pages, Google Documents, PDF, RTF, and .txt files.

## Copy The Questions

Please copy the questions when you send in your answers.

Copying the questions is additional practice writing in English and thinking in English.

Copying the questions makes it easy for us to review your answers.

Copying the questions helps you develop your ability to ask questions.

As you may already know 90% of professional work involves asking questions.

## Please keep your paragraph size to one or two sentences.

It is painful to read a big block of text.

Big blocks of compressed text are also incredibly difficult to correct.

Please add space above and below each line to make it easier to add corrections and feedback.

## Please write short, simple sentences.

Back in school, we were taught to write compound and complex sentences.

These sentences have more than one idea in a single sentence.

Complex sentences look intelligent on paper.

But when I started working, I discovered that I should minimize using complex sentences.

For business and day to day communication, simple sentences are BETTER.

GOOD FORMAT:

I have many short sentences. 

I have one idea in one sentence.

BAD FORMAT:

I have many ideas in one sentence.

Complex sentences are difficult to understand.

Complex sentences are also awkward to speak.

**Some reminders if you're writing by hand:**

## Please write legibly.

Based on personal experience, I found out that increasing the size of my handwriting to two lines or more had helped boost my confidence.

## Add Spaces

You need to add spaces to your writing, so you have a place to put notes and corrections.

Add a one-inch margin to the left and right of a page.

If you are using a bigger sheet of paper, add a two-inch margin on the left and right of the page.

Add one space between the lines.

## Include Page Title

Please add Titles at the top of the page.

## Please Label Parts and Page Numbers:

Please label parts and page numbers. 

Adding a label makes it easier for us to find your answers.

Examples:

    Page 1 of 11
    Part 1 of 11

## Scan Your Pages Properly

If your answers get too tricky to read, we'll ask you to send it again.
