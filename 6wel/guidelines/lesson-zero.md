## Tell Me About Yourself

My name is Kevin.

I live in ParaÃ±aque.

I previously worked in Makati.

I used to work in sales.

My previous job involves reaching out to decision-makers and sending a proposal.

We were selling products and services to other companies.

I want to work for a call center because of the high pay and the more predictable work hours.

I spend my free time writing, cooking, baking, blogging, going to the gym, going on road trips, and exploring with my bicycle.

## All Directions Your Interview Could Go

My interviewers are required to listen to every word I say and get me to talk more about what they find interesting.

Different people will have different interests.

If the interviewer is "all business" they would stick to asking about my work experience.

If my interviewer has a sales background my next questions will include:

- Tell me more about your sales experience.
- What's the most expensive item that you sold?
- What's the most difficult item that you sold?
- What's the easiest sale you made?
- Tell me a story about a specific sale that you made.
- What's the biggest amount of money that you made in sales.
- What is your attitude toward INSERT SALES TERM (quota, sales targets, prospecting, talking to foreigners, etc.)

If the interviewer is more traditional, I will be asked about the story of my education leading up my most recent job.

I may also be asked to talk about my family and my relationship with my other family members.

If the interviewer wants to know more about my attitude, personality, or simply build rapport before the business questions, I will be asked more about how I spent my free time.

If it's a guy, I'm often asked about my bike, cooking, writing, technology, blogging, etc.

From experience, men are often more interested in things and technical details.

If it's a girl, baking and cooking will be discussed, my travel experience and blogs will be discussed.

From experience, women are often more interested in people and relationships.

If the interviewer is an officer of the company, there's additional emphasis on how well I could do the work.

I will be asked to connect my current work experience to their current hiring needs.


## Keep it Professional

I've heard this advice in person and read this on the internet many times.

> "Are you interested in my past academic achievements or do you want me to talk about how I can help your company?"
 
The advice was, to lead the interviewer away from personal topics or topics that might negatively influence the hiring decision.

If the interviewer asks about something you don't feel like talking about or may negatively influence the hiring decision, you should change the topic.

> "I think we should stick to the most important thing here and that's how hiring me will benefit your company." 

I've never had the confidence to deliver any of the above-quoted lines.

I figured that I just needed to give a good answer to the personal questions that I'll be asked.

That's because I'm an introvert.

I hate talking about myself.

And that's the reason why I had a difficult time making friends, getting a girlfriend, getting a job, getting clients, getting business deals, and more.

If I wanted to overcome this problem, I needed to FORCE MYSELF to do what I naturally hate doing.

I decided I'm just going to talk about myself and do my best to have fun.

The size of my comfort zone determines the size of my income.

If I get rejected because of anything personal that I tell them, I shouldn't be working there.

I'll just presume that I won't fit the culture.

And there is nothing worse than getting hired in a company where the culture doesn't match your personality.

The other reason why I decided to work on my personal stories is that my interviewers are people.

Businesses are composed of people following instructions.

HR, the recruitment staff, hiring manager, or even the director or CEO are still people.

They're interested in my skill.

They're interested in checking how well I express myself in English.

They're interested in finding out if I'm a good person to hire.

They're also interested in finding out if I'm a good person.

That's because if they hire me, they'll be paying me whatever my monthly salary is for as long as I keep working there.

If the company pays 25k a month, then they will have an obligation to pay me Php 325,000 a year.

So they have to be really careful about hiring me.

They want to get the most out of me.

They also want to make sure that I don't cause any problems.

Asking about my personal background may not be the perfect way to find out but that's better than not asking.

That's all they got.

The final reason I'm okay with talking about my personal details is that based on experience, the longer my interview conversations are, the higher my chances of getting to the next stage.

So I don't mind talking about all my awkward past experiences.

## What other people do instead.

Many people research answers to interview questions.

They only talk about positive traits to describe themselves.

You should hire me because I'm:

- Honest
- Dedicated
- Hard-Working
- Reliable
- Dependable
- Flexible
- Have good communication skills.
- and any bullshit you can think of.

NOOOOO!!! 

Big NOOOO!!!

If a person says, you should trust me, you never trust that person.

If a person says, they're honest, do not believe that person.

If a person says, you should lend me money because I'm a good payer, do not lend that person money.

If a person says, I'm humble, just no!

If you were single and you were dating and you hear the person say.

I make a really good partner because I'm honest, dedicated, caring, hard-working, reliable, dependable, fun in bed, and your parents are going to love me.

You should run away.

In Filipino, we have a very strong term for that that during phone coaching almost everybody recognizes.

It's called, nagbubuhat ng sariling bangko.

If you shouldn't do that during dating, you shouldn't do that during interviews.

If your dating, your goal is to be in a relationship.

If you're looking for work, your goal is to get into an employee employer relationship.

You want the employer to trust you so they'll give you a job.

It's almost the same thing with the other relationship.

## Hiring Quota - Second Chance

Hiring staff have a quota.

They still need to get people hired.

So they have a strategy to give people who use positive traits a second chance.

They ask them to tell stories.

You tell stories to prove that you are who you say you are.

So if you're honest, you'll be asked a story about a time that you had to deliver bad news.

If you're dedicated, you'll be asked to tell a story about a time that you had to cancel a personal appointment so you can attend to a work obligation.

If you're hard working, you'll be asked to tell a story about your longest overtime.

If you're reliable, you'll be asked to tell a story about a compliment that you received from your boss.

If you're flexible, you'll be asked to talk about an experience where you're doing a task that's not part of your job description.

If you are able to tell that story clearly and confidently, you pass.

When you use positive words to describe yourself, you need to defend what you say.

Sometimes the conversation turns into a debate.

When a conversation turns into a debate it does not end well.

##

My solution is to use stories.

When I'm asked:

- What are your strengths?
- What are your weakness?
- Why should I hire you?
- Why shouldn't I hire you?
- Why do you want to work in a call center?
- What got you interested in applying here?

I answer with a story.

I answer with the same story.

I just move the details around because I want to acknowledge the question that the interviewer asked.

I didn't have good communication skills, I often find myself getting rejected by people at school, I don't have a lot of friends, I couldn't get a girlfriend, I'm not close friends with the popular crowd.

I was an extreme introvert.

I'm only interested in video games, martial arts, anime, science fiction, fantasy rock music and metal.

During my first day in college, I sat next to the prettiest girl in class, and asked her if she practiced kung fu.

When she said "no" I thanked her for her answer and stopped talking to her.

That's how bad my communication skills and people skills are.

I had to stop going to school because I couldn't communicate my goals properly to my parents.

I thought that I did my best, but from my explanation, they concluded that the best thing to do is to stop sending me to school.

I got rejected for a call center job so many times.

I got my first job because I was extremely lucky.

My interviewer is interested in martial arts and gave me a spot because he is interested in me teaching him a few moves.

This was a sales job. 

So I learned the basics of sales during training.

I also learned that anything I needed to know can be learned.

Our trainer asked us to draw Superman.

Everybody's drawing of Superman isn't very good.

But he asked us what would happen if we practiced drawing for a year, five years, ten years or twenty years.

We all agreed our drawing skill would keep getting better until it was close to perfect.

He taught us that the only way that would happen is if we kept on going.

Most people can't draw.

Most people also have some experience drawing back in school.

Many of those people quit after they leave school because for most jobs, drawing is not a requirement.

So most people quit and the skill disappears.

And that lesson stuck to me.

If I don't quit, and I keep on going, I can keep getting a little better and a little better and eventually, I'll level up.

Just like in a video game.

Just like in the gym.

Just like in martial arts.

And this works for any professional skill.

I may suck at the beginning but if I keep on going, I'll get better.

Then what's difficult will become easy and eventually effortless.

Anyone who's good at any skills simply has had a lot of practice.

If someone can do something, I can do that too.

Whatever it is.

So I passed training.

I started working.

It was a sales job.

So I got rejected 96 times a day.

I wasn't doing very well in my first two months.

I hit my quota on my third or fourth month.

I did some math and I realized I got rejected ten thousand times before I learned how to overcome my fear of rejection.

I took a real estate sales job.

I was also rejected for four months.

This was hearbreaking because we had no salary.

Then I made one sale.

I got paid 90k.

I sold a total of 11M made a total of 300k in that job then I left.

I tried insurance sales, that was a failure.

I only sold around 300k.

So every job that I took is a story about me being rejected and failing at the beginning, learning a skill and eventually getting better.

Every personal skill that I learned from cooking to martial arts to riding a bike to driving is also a failure at the beginning.

I'm 26 now. (NOTE: This was my age during my last call center interview so I'm using this as an example.)

And I'm beginning to realize that I'm running out of time.

I'm looking for work that pays well and that the pay is more predictable.

My first years in my career was spent working in sales.

I made a higher income, and it was fun and exciting but at the age that I'm in, I can't afford to have a big paycheck one month and a tiny or no paycheck some months.

Because that's what happens in sales.

If you have a lot of sales, you get a big commission.

If you don't make a sale, you get nothing.

I know that reputable call center companies pay well and pay on time, all the time.

So that's why I want to work here.

It's not as high as the usual pay that I'm used to, but the fact that the pay is more regular means that I'm going to cover my expenses and the extra money can be used to pay for my goals.

And I know that many people find call center work difficult.

And that's okay.

My past experience taught me that I'm going to do poorly at first.

But if I keep on going, I can learn the skill.

And if I keep on going, I can master the skill and the job becomes effortless.
