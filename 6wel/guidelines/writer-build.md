Here are some tasks if you want to become a writer.

I recommend that you have your own website.

But if you're starting, you're allowed to get a [free wordpress site](https://wordpress.com).

These writing exercises are easy,

The problem is, these exercises are also easy not to do.

You need to be clear with your goals and reasons.
