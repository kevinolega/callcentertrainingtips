You're probably curious if you sent the correct answers.

These are the most common mistakes.

I want you to use this page as reference to check your answers.

You can become a hundred times better at communicating by fixing the mistakes specified on this page.

### My first question:

If the interviewer gives his full name, you should introduce yourself with your first name.

If the interviewer gives his first name, you should use your first name or nickname.

BAD ANSWER: My name is Juan Carlo Antonio Miguel Lopez. You can call me Carlo for short.

GOOD ANSWER: My name is Carlo.

### Answering with a non-answer.

When you are asked a question, avoid the following answers:

Anything.

Up to you.

Letting them decide.

These answers signal that you don't use your intelligence.

Vague answers are just as bad.

I don't need a big amount to be happy.

I want to earn a lot of money.

I want a huge bank account.

I want to buy my dream house.

Vague answers mean you are indecisive, lazy and cannot be trusted.

These are all considered as non-answers.

Be specific with your answers.

### Single word answers.

- Yes
- No
- Other single word answers.

Instead, expand your answers.

No. I am currently looking for work.

Yes. I am previously working in a store.

Always answer using complete sentences.

### Multi sentence praragraphs. 

Please use one sentence paragraph.

Read the lesson about One Sentence Paragraph.

### Complex sentence to Simple Sentences:

If the sentence is 2 lines or more on your computer, shorten it.

If the sentence is 3 lines or more on your notebook, shorten it.

Short sentences have three to seven words.

Long sentences have eight or more words.

A compound or complex sentence is bad even if the grammar is correct.

My hobbies are watching TV, reading books and going to the gym.

I like watching TV.

I like reading books.

I enjoy going to the gym.

Simple sentences are easy to write and read.

Simple sentences are also easier speak and understand.

Most importantly, simple sentences are impossible to mess up.

### Complete your sentences

Here's what happens when people shorten their sentences.

ORIGINAL SENTENCE:

I spend my free time writing, cooking, and going to the gym.

BAD ANSWER:

I spend. 

My free time.

Writing.

Cooking.

Going to the gym.

THIS IS WRONG!!!

These are not complete sentences.

GOOD ANSWER:

I spend my free time writing.

I spend my free time cooking.

I spend my free time going to the gym.

This answer is okay.

You separated the ideas into a complete sentence. 

GREAT ANSWER:

I spend my free time writing.

I love cooking.

I enjoy going to the gym.

EXPLANATION:

You're allowed to make variations to the words.

You can make sentences less repetitive if you're creative.

You can search for synonyms of the words if you're not creative.

For example:

I did not repeat spend my free time.

I used the words love and enjoy.

Alternating the words make the sentence sound less repetitive.

### Opening with the wrong words.

Because - connect the question to the reason. I want to work in a call center because...

Actually - Using this word makes your speech sound like you lie frequently. If you remove this word, the meaning of your sentence won't change.

Honestly - Using this word makes your speech sound like you lie frequently. If you remove this, you will sound more honest.

And - You should write a new sentence that doesn't require that you begin the sentence with the word "and."

Or - see "and."

But - see "and."

Then - see "and."

So - see "and."

### Opening sentences with conjunctions

And...

Or...

But...

Then...

Because...

If you remove the words 

### Avoid/Replace these words:

Noted - I understand. I got you.

I reside at - I live in. 

K - Okay. I got you. I understand.

22 years of age - 22 years old.
