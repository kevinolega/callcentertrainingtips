You're probably curious if you sent the correct answers.

These are the most common mistakes.

I want you to use this page as reference to check your answers.

You can become a hundred times better at communicating by fixing the mistakes specified on this page.

We are going to answer the following questions:

- Should I give my full name or nickname during introductions?
- Why should I avoid vague or unspecific answers?
- Why should I avoid super-short answers?
- What are the most common grammar errors?
- What is a sentence?
- What mistakes do adults still make when writing sentences?
- How do I know if my sentence is complete?
- How can I become a better communicator?
- Why should I shorten my sentences?
- What are bad ways to begin my sentences?
- What are unnecessary words in a sentence?

### MY FIRST QUESTION:

If the interviewer gives his full name, you should introduce yourself with your full name.

If the interviewer gives his first name, you should use your first name or nickname.

BAD ANSWER: My name is Juan Carlo Antonio Miguel Lopez. You can call me Carlo for short.

GOOD ANSWER: My name is Carlo.

### ANSWERING WITH A NON-ANSWER.

When you are asked a question, avoid the following answers:

Anything.

Up to you.

Letting them decide.

These answers signal that you don't use your intelligence.

Vague answers are just as bad.

I don't need a big amount to be happy.

I want to earn a lot of money.

I want a huge bank account.

I want to buy my dream house.

Vague answers mean you are indecisive, lazy and cannot be trusted.

These are all considered as non-answers.

Be specific with your answers.

### SINGLE WORD ANSWERS.

- Yes
- No
- Other single word answers.

Instead, expand your answers.

No. I am currently looking for work.

Yes. I am previously working in a store.

Always answer using complete sentences.

### REPETITIVE GRAMMAR ERRORS

Many of the errors that we discover during coaching show up again and again.

Please shorten and simplify your sentences.

You are allowed to write more sentences as long as you write short sentences.

Here are the top errors.

### WHAT IS A SENTENCE? PART 1

A sentence is a group of words that express a complete thought.

A sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation mark.

### CAPITALIZATION

You understand what I mean.

Look at this lesson.

All the sentences start with a capital letter.

### PUNCTUATION

Look at all the sentences in this lesson.

Did you notice that most of the sentences end with a period?

Some sentences ended with a question mark.

Most of the sentences end with a period.

Please do not skip the period.

### WHAT IS A SENTENCE? PART 2

A sentence needs to have a subject, a verb, and an object.

The subject is usually a noun.

The verb is the action word.

The object is the receiver of the action.

### INCOMPLETE SENTENCES

Incomplete sentences are groups of words that do not express a complete thought.

One or more of the parts of the sentence is missing.

There is no subject.

There is no verb or action word.

There is no object or receiver of the action.

### MULTI SENTENCE PRARAGRAPHS. 

Please use the one-sentence paragraph format.

Read the lesson about the one-sentence paragraph format.

Add a blank space between the lines.

Don't just use double-space on your Google Document.

The space allows us to see the errors clearly.

I also put the correction on the space.

### COMPLEX SENTENCE TO SIMPLE SENTENCES:

Shorten your sentence if you see two or more lines on your computer.

Shorten your sentence if you see three or more lines on your notebook.

Short sentences have three to seven words.

Long sentences have eight or more words.

A compound or complex sentence is bad even if the grammar is correct.

My hobbies are watching TV, reading books, and going to the gym.

I like watching TV.

I like reading books.

I enjoy going to the gym.

Simple sentences are easy to write and read.

Simple sentences are also easier speak and understand.

Most importantly, simple sentences are impossible to mess up.

### COMPLETE YOUR SENTENCES

Please complete your sentences when you shorten your sentences.

Here's what happens when people shorten their sentences.

ORIGINAL SENTENCE:

I spend my free time writing, cooking, and going to the gym.

BAD ANSWER:

I spend. 

My free time.

Writing.

Cooking.

Going to the gym.

THIS IS WRONG!!!

These are not complete sentences.

GOOD ANSWER:

I spend my free time writing.

I spend my free time cooking.

I spend my free time going to the gym.

This answer is okay.

You separated the ideas into a complete sentence. 

GREAT ANSWER:

I spend my free time writing.

I love cooking.

I enjoy going to the gym.

EXPLANATION:

You're allowed to make variations to the words.

You can make sentences less repetitive if you're creative.

You can search for synonyms of the words if you're not creative.

For example:

I did not repeat spend my free time.

I used the words love and enjoy.

Alternating the words make the sentence sound less repetitive.

### OPENING WITH THE WRONG WORDS.

Because - connect the question to the reason. I want to work in a call center because...

Actually - Using this word makes your speech sound like you lie frequently. If you remove this word, the meaning of your sentence won't change.

Honestly - Using this word makes your speech sound like you lie frequently. If you remove this, you will sound more honest.

And - You should write a new sentence that doesn't require that you begin the sentence with the word "and."

Or - see "and."

But - see "and."

Then - see "and."

So - see "and."

### OPENING SENTENCES WITH CONJUNCTIONS

And...

Or...

But...

Then...

Because...

If you remove the words above, the sentence likely has the same meaning.

And I will go to the mall.

I will go to the mall.

Or I will go home.

I will go home.

But I am not happy.

I am not happy.

Then we went to the movies.

We went to the movies.

Because I was writing.

I was writing.

### Avoid/Replace these words:

Noted - I understand. I got you.

I reside at - I live in. 

K - Okay. I got you. I understand.

22 years of age - 22 years old. 

### ACTIVE AND PASSIVE VOICE

We use active voice in a call center 99% of the time.

We use passive voice to soften a potentially offensive statement.

I'll give you the definition and some examples.

### WHAT IS ACTIVE VOICE?

The sentence is in the active voice when the subject is the doer of the action.

I wote my ideas in my notebook.

I did the work.

### WHAT IS PASSIVE VOICE?

The sentence is in the passive voice when the subject is the receiver of the action.

The ideas on the notebook were written by me.

The work was done by me.

### WHEN TO USE ACTIVE VOICE

I recommend using active voice most of the time.

The sentences are more direct and easy to write.

### WHEN TO USE PASSIVE VOICE

This is 1% of the time.

We can't give you a refund. - ACTIVE VOICE

Unfortunately, the company does not process refunds at this time. PASSIVE.

This part is a little tricky.

Please search for more examples on Google.

I'll give you a separate lesson on Positive Phrasing.
