You're probably curious if you sent the correct answers.

These are the most common mistakes.

I want you to use this page as reference to check your answers.

You can become a hundred times better at communicating by fixing the mistakes specified on this page.

### My first question:

If the interviewer gives his full name, you should introduce yourself with your first name.

If the interviewer gives his first name, you should use your first name or nickname.

BAD ANSWER: My name is Juan Carlo Antonio Miguel Lopez. You can call me Carlo for short.

GOOD ANSWER: My name is Carlo.

### Answering with a non-answer.

When you are asked a question, avoid the following answers:

Anything.

Up to you.

Letting them decide.

These answers signal that you don't use your intelligence.

Vague answers are just as bad.

I don't need a big amount to be happy.

I want to earn a lot of money.

I want a huge bank account.

I want to buy my dream house.

Vague answers mean you are indecisive, lazy and cannot be trusted.

These are all considered as non-answers.

Be specific with your answers.

### Single word answers.

- Yes
- No
- Other single word answers.

Instead, expand your answers.

No. I am currently looking for work.

Yes. I am previously working in a store.

Always answer using complete sentences.

### Multi sentence praragraphs. 

Please use one sentence paragraph.

Read Lesson 6.

### Complex sentence to Simple Sentences:

If the sentence is 2 lines or more on your computer, shorten it.

If the sentence is 3 lines or more on your notebook, shorten it.

Short sentences have three to seven words.

Long sentences have eight or more words.

A compound or complex sentence is bad even if the grammar is correct.

My hobbies are watching TV, reading books and going to the gym.

I like watching TV.

I like reading books.

I enjoy going to the gym.

Simple sentences are easy to write and read.

Simple sentences are also easier speak and understand.

Most importantly, simple sentences are impossible to mess up.

### Opening with the wrong words.

Because - connect the question to the reason. I want to work in a call center because...

Actually - Using this word makes your speech sound like you lie frequently. If you remove this word, the meaning of your sentence won't change.

Honestly - Using this word makes your speech sound like you lie frequently. If you remove this, you will sound more honest.

### Avoid/Replace these words:

Noted - I understand. I got you.

I reside at - I live in. 

K - Okay. I got you. I understand.
