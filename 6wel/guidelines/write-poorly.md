If you're having a stressful time writing, start by writing poorly.

I'm serious.

I don't care if your writing isn't great.

Just put words on paper.

Write your thoughts on paper.

Don't worry about grammar.

We can fix that all later.

The worst outcome is an empty page.

Write a bad first draft.

Attempt to list 20 things that you want to say.

Just focus on writing one short sentence.

When you finished writing your first short sentence, write another short sentence.

Repeat the process until you have twenty short sentences.

After you put your ideas, thoughts, emotions, and stories on paper, read it aloud.

The next step is to edit your work until you're impressed with how your writing sounds.

Organize your writing.

Add margins and spaces.

Follow a one-sentence paragraph format.

This format allows you to find and fix errors quickly.

Break longer sentences into many shorter sentences.

Replace the wrong words.

Use better words.

Read your answers aloud.

Listen to how it sounds.

Fix it until you are happy with it.

I landed high paying jobs after writing short stories about my life.
