## Additional Insturctions

Make your answers as long as possible.

Use short sentences.

Use the one-sentence paragraph format.

If the question requires you to tell stories or give instructions, make your answers as detailed as you can.

In the first three weeks, we want you to give long answers.

In the next three weeks, we will shorten your answers.

Please format and organize your answers to make your answers easy to check.

Before you submit your answers, read your answers aloud, and listen to how it sounds.

Ask yourself how you can communicate your answers better.

## Week 1 Lesson 3

Make it a habit to write down your questions.

I want you to collect questions that you can ask me during the phone coaching session.

Having no questions doesn't mean that you understood the lesson.

Having no questions gives the impression that you're not interested or you're a passive learner.

Collect your questions.

Collect your ideas.

Revisit your ideas in your notebook.

## Week 1 Lesson 4

Write two short sentences for each of the top 100 words.

Week 1 Lesson 5

Please Be Sure To Apply The One-Sentence Paragraph Format.

As the lesson said, a one-sentence paragraph means that instead of grouping multiple sentences together to form a long paragraph, you limit the size of the paragraph to a single sentence.

You should instead put your ideas in many sentences.

Just focus on writing 100 sentences about the topics, I asked you to write about.

The sentences don't have to be long and complicated.

Short, simple sentences will do.

Don't try to write long, complex sentences.
