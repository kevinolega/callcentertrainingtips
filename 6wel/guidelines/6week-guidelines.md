## Start Date

The training materials will be sent to your email address.

We send out our lessons at 9 am.

If you do not receive an email on the first day, please send us a message so we can check.

In many situations, the email can be found in the SPAM folder so please check there too.

## Purpose of the Training

We provide our students with a safe space to practice their English with a dedicated instructor through writing activities and one to one phone coaching.

We deliver lessons via email and phone coaching to make the learning experience affordable and convenient for both the student and the instructor.

## Training Materials

Please read the emails carefully and download the PDF to your phone or computer.

Our goal is to help you develop your ability to express yourself in English comfortably and confidently.

We begin with opening up topics about yourself and slowly transition to more professional and work related conversations.

## Please do all the writing activities.

In order to improve your speaking ability, we need to evaluate the quality of the words that you use through the writing activities. 

Please purchase two notebooks because you will be doing a lot of writing.

Purchase more notebooks as you require.

Done correctly, we expect you to complete anywhere from 200 to 800 pages of writing at the end of the six week period.

## Call For Help

If you have any questions or you’re experiencing any difficulty, please send me a message and we will assist you.

If a link doesn't work or you can't access a lesson, please let me know so we can fix it.

## Certificate of Completion

We can provide a certificate of completion upon completion of all 42 lessons at your request.

We can also provide letters of recommendations and resume building assistance at a minimal cost.

## Non Refundable

The tuition is non-refundable.

## Freeze Policy

If for any reason, you need more time to finish the lessons or reschedule your phone coaching for an indefinite period, please let us know.

We did specify a six week period for the lessons however we would prefer to not implement a finished or not finished policy.

If you need more time, we will give you more time.

That being said, if you have an emergency, a conflict with your schedule or any other commitment that will prevent you from continuing the lessons, please inform us so we can freeze your account.

## Continue After Long Breaks

To continue the lessons, you only need to send us a message and we will continue where you left off.

We keep a record of your info so you never have to worry that we'll forget about you.

## Testimonials

You may have noticed that our price is crazy cheap.

We are in the process of building a bigger reputation.

One reason why we offered the lessons at a really affordable price is we are collecting testimonials.

When you get hired please let us know.

We enjoy reading these stories.

We also share testimonials to encourage our other students.

## Daily Email Lessons and Activities

Building English skills, like any skill, requires daily practice and study.

To improve the quality of the words that you use, we are doing writing activities to evaluate your existing vocabulary and grammar as well as your comprehension.

## Write Daily

We send out the lessons and writing activities at 9am every day.

Please answer all the questions to the best of your ability.

## Learn Basic Research

For words and phrases that you need help with, a quick search on Google is incredibly useful.

Research is a small but incredibly useful call center skill.

## Activity Deadlines

As for the deadline, we'll give you all the time that you need.

But please don't take too long.

From personal experience, we discovered that people who skip writing for three days or longer end up not completing the lessons at all.

We will still wait for you.

If you paid for the lessons, we'll always give you the chance to continue the lessons. 

## On Forming Habits...

What you do becomes a habit.

What you DON'T do also becomes a habit.

So please spend time writing every day.

Even if it's just thirty minutes a day.

Even if it's just ten minutes twice a day.

Set a schedule and commit to writing every day.

Turn off your notifications and focus on writing.

You can send in your answers at any time we're waiting for you.

## Our Goal is to Teach You Not Grade You

Instead of grading you as passed or failed, we will give you the opportunity to try again.

We would provide you with feedback on how to answer better and simply ask you to repeat the activity with your new knowledge.

Please repeat all the activities that you need to repeat.

## Please write legibly.

## Modules and Lessons

You need to complete your answers and we need to check your answers before proceeding to the next module.

We are committed to helping our students have a smooth experience with upgrading their English skills.

We have found it beneficial to avoid giving the student information overload or overwhelming the student with many activities.

We will be sending lessons 1 to 7 first.

After we received all seven activities, we will check and ask the student to answer any incomplete activities before sending the next set of lessons.

We will ONLY send you the next batch of activities after we have confirmed that you have completed the current week of activities.

We need you to complete the first seven activities before your first phone coaching session.

### Save Your Questions
