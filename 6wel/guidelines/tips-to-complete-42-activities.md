We expect everyone to take their time to write complete answers.

Writing your best answers is better than sending us your fastest answers.

Unless you make your living as a professional writer, we expect this process to take time.

Do not sacrifice the quality of your writing so you can finish the lessons as quickly as possible.

### Shorten Your Writing Sessions

If you don't have the time to write, shorten your writing sessions.

If a lesson is challenging or difficult, focus on answering just one question at a time.

Some questions require a full day to come up with a proper answer, and that is okay.

### List Your Ideas

If you can't think of an answer, I found it helpful, making a list of ten possible answers and combining my ideas to create a good answer.

### Read Your Answers Aloud

Reading the lessons aloud, as well as your answers multiple times, is good practice.

### Listen to Yourself

Recording your voice as you read your answers and listening is not required but extremely helpful for independent learners.

### Repeating and Rewriting

It's always a good idea to rewrite your answer to a question whenever you have a better answer ready.

Repeating and rewriting is a failure's greatest fear.

At the same time, repeating and rewriting is a master's shortcut.

### Sincerely Study and Review

Make it a habit to review a lesson and review your answers.

There is no reading material that's so good that you only have to read it once, and you're done.

Leaders are readers.

Even religious leaders read and study their Bible every day.

Lawyers and doctors review their legal and medical books and case files regularly.

Studying is something you can't escape. 

And people who believe that they can avoid studying can fall into worse circumstances.

Avoiding studying is very much like running away from your teacher's punishment by hiding inside a burning building.

### Don't Quit

To complete this program, you are only required to read the training materials, answer the questions, and send in your answers.

We will read your answers, tell you what's wrong, teach you how to fix the problems, and discuss during your phone coaching.

That's it.

It's only for six weeks.

If you can't finish six weeks of writing, emailing, and talking on the phone, what makes you think you can speak with sixty to one hundred Americans a day eight hours a day, five days a week? 

What makes you think you can succeed in learning more challenging and complex tasks like running a business?

### Don't take shortcuts

The shortcut is the extended cut.

Don't try to avoid work.

Don't make yourself a failure simply because you lost to laziness.

Remember this:

If you take shortcuts, you don't deserve success.

To deserve success, you have to reject shortcuts.
