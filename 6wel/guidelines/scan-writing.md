If you don't have a lot of time, use the scanner app on your smartphone.

I have developed the habit of scanning my notes, so I always have a copy in case the paper gets lost or ruined.

Scanning your writing using a smartphone is a quick way to have a digital backup of your notes.

You can encode your most important writing on a computer later.

Please remember to include page titles and page numbers as well as part numbers (if needed) to the page before a scan to make your writing easier to organize and review.

If you're using an Android phone, Google Drive and Google Keep have a scanner function.

If you're using an iPhone, the Notes app has a scanner function inside the app.

Please scan the pages in the morning or from a bright, well-lit room.

Avoid using pencils, colored pens, or shiny ink because these are difficult for the scanner to read.

Please always check for readability or faded scans before sending or disposing of your paper scan.

If the photo is more readable than the scan, please send us the picture instead.

Here's a video on how to organize your scanned photos.
