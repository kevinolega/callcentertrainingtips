## Writing for 15 Minutes a Day

When you write for fifteen minutes a day:

You may write one sentence per minute.

Every day you've written 15 sentences.

Every week you've written 105 sentences.

After one month, you've written 420 sentences.

After six weeks, you've written 630 sentences.

After three months, you've written 1,250 sentences.

After six months, you've written 2,520 sentences.

After one year, you've written 5,050 sentences.

After three years, you've written 15,120 sentences.

After five years, you've written 25,200 sentences.

After ten years, you've written 50,400 sentences.

After twenty years, you've written 100,800 sentences.

People tend to overestimate what they can do in a day and underestimate what they can accomplish if they were only consistent for longer than a year.
