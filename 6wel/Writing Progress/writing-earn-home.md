If you're considering earning money from your writing, I recommend you only start part time.

Don't commit to a new job until after you're earning well.

When I became a writer, I had clients who were willing to pay me before I quit my call center work.

Just work Monday to Friday.

Just work one to three hours maximum.

Keep your job.

Save the money that you earn from writing and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

I'll tell you how much money you can earn.
