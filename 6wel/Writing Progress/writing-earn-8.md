## My Second Year as a Freelance Writer Part 2

When I got more experience as a writer, I earned $2.50 for every 100 words that I've written.

Many of the articles that I've written are between 300 to 500 words.

Now and then, I write a 1,000 or 2,000-word article.

I made $7.50 for a 300-word article.

I made $12.50 for a 500-word article.

I made $25 for a 1,000-word article.

I made $50 for a 2,000-word article.

I wrote at a speed of one sentence per minute.

I estimate that each sentence is approximately 3-5 words.

If I focused on writing for eight hours a day and completed three longer articles, I earned $60 that day.

I made $1,200 that month.

If that's the only money I made that year, that's $14,400 at the end of the year.

$60 is worth Php 3,000.

$1,200 is worth Php 60,000.

$14,400 is Php 720,000.

I kept a less stressful part-time job that is close to home, where I had to sit at a booth and man the store.

I wrote for eight hours a day. 

When the store closed at night, I'd sit in a coffee shop to continue writing.

I'm happy I had enough money to pay for Starbucks.

I'm happy I've recovered some of the money that I used to buy my computer and pay for my internet connection.

I'm happy that the simple activity that I used to improve my life is now a source of income.

I know that more experienced writers earn more money.

I did not continue working as a professional writer at this point.

I worked a more stressful job as a virtual assistant and eventually got promoted to a project manager.

But that's for another story.
