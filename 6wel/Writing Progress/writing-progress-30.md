## Writing for 30 Minutes a Day

When you write for thirty minutes a day:

You may write one sentence per minute.

Every day you've written 30 sentences.

Every week you've written 210 sentences.

After one month, you've written 840 sentences.

After six weeks, you've written 1,260 sentences.

After three months, you've written 2,520 sentences.

After six months, you've written 5,040 sentences.

After one year, you've written 10,080 sentences.

After three years, you've written 30,240 sentences.

After five years, you've written 50,400 sentences.

After ten years, you've written 100,400 sentences.

After twenty years, you've written 201,600 sentences.

People tend to overestimate what they can do in a day and underestimate what they can accomplish if they were only consistent for longer than a year.
