## My Second Year as a Freelance Writer Part 1

When I got more experience as a writer, I earned $2.50 for every 100 words that I've written.

Many of the articles that I've written are between 300 to 500 words.

Now and then, I write a 1,000 or 2,000-word article.

I made $7.50 for a 300-word article.

I made $12.50 for a 500-word article.

I made $25 for a 1,000-word article.

I made $50 for a 2,000-word article.

I wrote at a speed of one sentence per minute.

I estimate that each sentence is approximately 3-5 words.

If I worked for six hours a day and completed two longer articles, I earned $45 that day.

I made an extra $900 that month.

If that's the only money I made that year, that's $10,800 at the end of the year.

$45 is worth Php 2,250.

$900 is worth Php 45,000.

$10,800 is Php 540,000.

If I kept a less stressful part-time job that is close to home, and wrote for six hours a day, and saved the money that I earned writing articles, I would have an additional Php 540,000 at the end of the year.

This amount of money is double my call center income.

At this point, I got a part-time job close to home watching a gym's front desk.
