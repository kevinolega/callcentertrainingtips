When you're more experienced, you may charge higher.

The hardest part is getting your first few clients.

When you have a regular client, you may request for additional writing jobs.

You may continue reaching out to new clients so you can get more jobs.

Don't take on too much work.

Underpromise and overdeliver.

Focus on sustaining a consistent income instead of giant leaps.

Because if you leap too far and you're not prepared, you'll end up falling to the bottom.

After my first year, I left my call center work and took a lower paying and less stressful part time job close to my home that will allow me to write four to five hours a day.
