When you get better at writing, you'll get better at other areas.

I noticed that after writing everyday, I got better at almost everything else.

I became better at sales.

I became better at customer service.

I became better at tech support.

I became better at managing people.

I became better at managing resources.

I became better at learning new skills.

I learned how to cook.

I learned how to lift weights.

I learned to bike long distance.

I learned more martial arts.

I learned from a lot of books.

I became friends with a lot of mentors.

More importantly, I developed my writing skills.

In 2009, I decided to buy a website and post my writings publicly.

Owning a website gave potentiall employers the impression that I'm a tech genius.

No other applicant that I competed owned a website.

Only people in high positions own a website.

They thought that I was an expert.

In 2010, I got a corporate sales job that paid over 40k a month.

The job allowed me to save enough money to go on my first mini-retirement.

In 2013, I ran out of money so I went job hunting at a call center.

I got hired at West Contact Services.

I continued writing on the side.

I wrote on the bus on my way to work.

I'm scribbling notes during breaks and during avail.

I wrote on the shuttle on my way home.

I was posting some of my writing on my websites when I got home.

In 2016, I tried getting a job as a writer.

I found a part time job.

After a few months, after receiving my first paycheck, I decided that I will begin working from home.
