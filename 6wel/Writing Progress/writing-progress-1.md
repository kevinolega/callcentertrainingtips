## Writing for 1 Hour a Day

When you write for one hour a day:

You may write one sentence per minute.

Every day you've written 60 sentences.

Every week you've written 420 sentences.

After one month, you've written 1,680 sentences.

After six weeks, you've written 2,520 sentences.

After three months, you've written 5,040 sentences.

After six months, you've written 10,080 sentences.

After one year, you've written 20,160 sentences.

After three years, you've written 30,240 sentences.

After five years, you've written 50,400 sentences.

After ten years, you've written 100,800 sentences.

After twenty years, you've written 201,600 sentences.

People tend to overestimate what they can do in a day and underestimate what they can accomplish if they were only consistent for longer than a year.
