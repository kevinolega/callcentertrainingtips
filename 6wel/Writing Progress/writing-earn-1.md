## My First Month as a Freelance Writer

When I got hired as a writer, I made $1 for every 100 words that I've written.

Many of the articles that I've written are between 300 to 500 words.

I made $3 for a 300-word article.

I made $5 for a 500-word article.

I wrote at a speed of one sentence per minute.

I estimate that each sentence is approximately 3-5 words.

If I worked for one hour a day and completed one short article, I earned $3 that day.

I made an extra $60 that month.

If that's the only money I made that year, that's $720 at the end of the year.

$3 is worth Php 150.

$60 is worth Php 3,000.

$720 is Php 36,000.

If I kept my call center job, wrote for an hour a day, and saved the money that I earned writing short articles, I would have an additional Php 36,000 at the end of the year.
