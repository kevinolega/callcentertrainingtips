## My First Year as a Freelance Writer Part 1

When I got a little more experience as a writer, I earned $1.50 for every 100 words that I've written.

Many of the articles that I've written are between 300 to 500 words.

I made $4.50 for a 300-word article.

I made $7.50 for a 500-word article.

I wrote at a speed of one sentence per minute.

I estimate that each sentence is approximately 3-5 words.

If I worked for four hours a day and completed four short articles, I earned $18 that day.

I made an extra $360 that month.

If that's the only money I made that year, that's $4,320 at the end of the year.

$18 is worth Php 900.

$360 is worth Php 18,000.

$4,320 is Php 216,000.

If I kept a less stressful part-time job that is close to home, and wrote for four hours a day, and saved the money that I earned writing short articles, I would have an additional Php 216,000 at the end of the year.
