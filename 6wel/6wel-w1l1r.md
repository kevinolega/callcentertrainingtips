Please read this multiple times and go back to your answers and make the needed changes.

### Our main goal is to get you comfortable expressing yourself.

That includes your thoughts, ideas, stories and anything that you might want to say.

### Please try to give longer answers. 

During interviews, we want to give thoughtful and concise answers.

During practice, we want you to make your answers as long as possible so we can expose and identify all your good ideas and use the best ones for the short version.

We will shorten your answers at the end (Week 6) but for now, please try to expand your answers to all the activities and make them as long as possible.

### My typical workday in a call center is...

To give you an example, I'm going to give you an overview of what happens during my workday.

I'm going to tell you what happens from the start of the day to what happens at the end of the day.

#### Start Of Day:

I wake up at 12 midnight because my shift is at 2am.

I get ready and leave the house before 12:30am.

I commute to the office and arrive about 30 minutes before my schedule.

I use the extra time to freshen up and buy what I need from the convenience store.

I get to my work station 15 minutes before my actual time and prepare my tools and get comfortable.

I made it a practice to meditate for a few minutes and visualize a good outcome before the start of the shift.

At exactly 2am, I log in and start taking calls.

**Call Flow**

I usually greet the customers and introduce myself:

> Thank you for calling (company name) this is Kevin.

I acknowledge the caller’s concern and reassure them that I’m there to assist them.

I ask clarifying questions about their concern.

I solve their problem.

When we’re done, I ask them if they need additional help.

I thank them for calling.

Then I repeat the process.

**Breaks**

We have a lunch break and two short breaks.

I usually take a nap instead of eating because I need extra energy.

If the day becomes stressful, I put on my headset and meditate using the Headspace app for ten minutes.

Most good call centers have a proper sleeping area.

**End Of Day**

I log out from my work station at exactly 11am.

I use the restroom.

I say goodbye to my teamleader and workmates.

I leave the building and commute home.

Every now and then, I take a short detour to a deli or the mall to buy ingredients for my meals.

I get home at around 2pm.

I prepare my list of things to do the next day, my clothes, my meals, I clean up and go to bed at 3pm.


## Additional things to fix:

### Please answer using complete sentences.

I want to work in a call center because…

I chose my course because…

I want to earn Php 25,000/month because…

Incomplete sentences are a negative point during interviews.

### Please be specific with your answer. 

Specificity implies clarity of thinking and sincerity. 

If you give vague answers, you are giving employers the impression that you are vague, undependable and difficult to talk to because you can’t communicate properly.

Here are some examples:

I want to earn 25,000/month is better than I want to earn a higher salary.

I want to have Php 250,000 in my bank account after five years is better I want my bank account to be six figures.


### Please write down the complete instructions.

This is important because call center interviewers judge applicants based on how well they give instructions.

Instructions need to be in order. 

Open with a summary then include the step by step.

**Summary:**

I'm going to teach you how to cook steak. 

To cook steak, you need to get the pan to high heat, let the steak cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, rest for five minutes then serve.

**Step by step:**

Step one: Heat the pan.

Step two: Add the oil.

Step three: When the pan is on high heat, carefully place the steak in the pan and let the steak cook for 1-2 minutes on each side.

Step four: Flip the steak to the other side.

Step five: Transfer the steak to a plate and let the steak rest for five minutes.

Step six: Serve and enjoy.

### Please complete the story. 

We want you to develop your story telling skills.

This is important because this is the best way to answer the question “why should we hire you” and any follow up questions the interviewer will likely ask you during the interview is to tell a story.

At the end of the six week training period, we want you to have over fifty stories ready so there is ZERO reason for you to fail.

### Simple Introductions

My name is Kevin Olega. (I use my nickname and my last name instead of my full name)

I live in Parañaque. (If your location is well known, you can shorten it)

I studied at iAcademy (I don’t give the full school name)

I studied Business Management (I don’t give the full course name)

**Should I give the short version or the full version?**

Here are some guidelines that I follow:

If the questions is...

“Where do you live?” give them the short version. I live in Parañaque.

“What is your address?” give your full address. I live in Paper Street, BF Homes, Sucat Parañaque.

“Where did you study?” I just say the short name of the school. iAcademy in Makati.

“What’s the full name of your school?” I give the full name of the school. Information and Communications Academy in Makati.

“What is your course?” I give them the short version. Business Management.

“What is your course and major?” that’s when I give the full version. I studied BS Business Administration major in eManagement.

## What to do next?

After reading this, please review your answers and ask yourself this question:

**How can I communicate this answer better?**

Then make the needed changes.

I just wanted to remind you that we are always here to support you.

Send me a message with your questions so we can assist.

Thanks.

Kevin.
