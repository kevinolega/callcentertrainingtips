Please read this multiple times and go back to your answers and make the needed changes.

Please remember that the Fun with Formats lesson is a guide on how you can make your writing longer or shorter depending on what your goal is.

For the activity, we want you to make your answers as long as possible because we want you to have options to pick your best answer.

During interviews, the initial answers to questions are often just 3-5 sentences.

However, if you say something that the interview is interesting, or confusing, they will ask you to give more details.

Tell me more about... INTERESTING WORD YOU SAID.

What do you mean by… UNCLEAR ANSWER.

Give me an example of …. SOMETHING YOU JUST SAID.

Tell me a story about a time… POSITIVE TRAIT YOU USED TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF.

Please elaborate…. TOPIC YOU MENTIONED.

Chances are you have these answers in your head but I’m willing to bet that your supporting answers are not in English or not carefully considered answers.

REMEMBER:

The interviewer is:
Testing your English
Testing if you are telling the truth.
Testing if you have problem solving skills.
Testing if you have a good attitude.
Testing if you are sincere with what you are saying.
Testing if you really prepared for your interview.

This is your opportunity.

I have added some additional questions to help you think of ideas on what to include.

Feel free to add more details that you feel is important.

You want to be the person that:

They can hire you for the job.
They can depend on you.
They can get you as a godparent to their kid.
They can trust you to always be on time and never be absent.
They can hand you problems and expect you to find a solution.
They can proudly tell the owner of the company that they hired you.
They can use you as a model for the company’s social media advertising.
They won’t regret hiring you.

The best way is to prepare all these in your writing.

This exercise is intended to help you expand your ideas so you can pick the best answers for your actual interview.

We want longer options so you can think about life, goals, struggles and use the stories to convince the interviewer to hire you.

The more things you can say, the more you are able to showcase your communication skills.
