Sales is an essential professional skill.

People who can sell make more money that people who can't sell.

Sales is also an important communication skill.

If you know how to sell and understand the principles of sales, you will never worry about not having a job.

If your sales skill level is high enough, you never have to worry about money for the rest of your life.

For people who grew up with families who own businesses, selling is a basic skill.

Selling is very much like a combination of a martial art and a language.

If you know how to sell, you have a GIANT advantage over people who don't know how to sell.

I used the word GIANT because the advantage is so big, it's almost unfair.

The more times you practice, the better you become at sales.

I have friends who grew up in families that owned several businesses and selling is normal practice to them ever since they were young.

When we got to start working, my friends with sales experience were already comfortably earning six figure incomes while I was just learning how to sell and making less than minimum wage.

This is very much like a comparrison of an athlete who started training at four to six years old and a casual hobbyist who just stared learning the sport in his twenties.

This is the reason why a lot of people feel defeated in sales.

The are "monsters" in sales but it's for a different reason.

Sales is like any skill.

It takes time to develop.

When you become fairly good sales skills becomes extremely valuable.

There is no shame in failing as you learn sales.

You will use your sales skills until you get older.

You will only suck at sales if you quit.

This happens when you quit learning a skill.

Sales skills apply to getting a job.

Sales skills apply to earning MORE money.

Sales skills apply to making good friends.

Sales skills applies to relationships and family.

Sales skills applies to business.

The people who master sales skills early often do exceptionally well in these other "non-sales" related areas.

Sales skills also apply to call center work.

That's why I'm teaching this skill.

In customer service and tech support, having a high enough level in sales skills helps convince the customers to cooperate with your instructions and boost your primary KPI.

You get higher customer service feedback.

You also get better AHT scores.

Your work also becomes less stressful overall because you understand sales princples.

Here are some sales lessons.

## Sales Lessons

A person buys to make a gain or stop a pain.

People are looking for a benefit.

When you are trying to sell to someone, remind them of the benefit.

Other people buy because they are looking for a solution to a problem.

## What is the stronger motivation for a sale?

If a person is extremely logical, they want the benefit.

If the person is emotional, they want to stop the pain.

People who are capable of buying are usually okay.

They usually don't need to buy.

They buy because they just feel like it.

In a lot of situations, the gain is not strong enough motivation for people to take action.

99% follow a very specific way of thinking and living based on emotions.

1% often do the opposite and that's following logic.

## Common Resons Why People Don't Buy

These are the common reasons why people don't buy.

- No Trust
- No Need
- No Worry
- No Help
- No Hurry
- No Money

Let's discuss these elements one by one.

## No Trust

You won't buy people you don't trust. 

Trust is the number one reason people buy.

Trust is also the biggest reason people don't buy.

Trust is also difficult to establish because a prospect will never directly say "I don't trust you."

The prospect will end up smiling and agreeing with you and leave without buying anything.

## No Need

If the prospect doesn't seen the need, they won't buy.

It's your job as a sales person to discover the needs of the customer and remind the customer of their needs.

## No Worry

If there is no worry, the customer doesn't need to buy.

Many of our purchases involves, buying things to prevent bad things from happening.

We buy insurance to secure money for our family in case we die.

We buy a house because we are worried about not being able to pay rent in the future.

We buy good clothes and other status symbols because we are worried about how other people see us.

We send our kids to school because we are worried that they will grow up stupid and other people will take advatage of them.

The customer's worry is the reason why the customer will buy.

## No Help

If the customer sees your offer as a solution to the problem, and they trust you, they will buy from you.

If the customer does not see your solution is the best way to help them, they will walk away and you DON'T make a sale.

## No Hurry
If there is no urgency, even if there is a need, the prospect won't buy.

Urgency simply means that they need to take a positive action today.

If a person does not see the importance of buying the product now, they won't buy.

No Money is the final reason.

This is the final reason because this is the least important.

If trust is established.

If the needs are discovered and discussed.

If the customer sees the urgency of making a positive action.

Sales Stories:

In 2005, I got hired at DMCI Homes as a sales agent.

I couldn't make a sale.

It's more painful because at the time, if you're a real estate agent and you don't make a sale, you don't have an allowance.

I recieved a 5k allowance.

My sales manager asked me to use that to pay for newspaper advertisements.

I used that money for advertisement.

I went to that job but didn't have any money for four months.

I used up all my money.

I borrowed money from my family.

Eventually, they stopped giving me money.

I still went to work.

I still handed out filers.

I went to all the parking lots in Makati that I could enter and left fliers on cars.

I gave filers at the malls and office buildings and got kicked out by the guards for not having a permit.

When I ran out of money, I convinced the nearby eatery to let me eat there for a few more days because I was just waiting for my pay.


I wasn't really expecting to get paid because I don't have a sale yet.

I lied to the bus conductor to ride from Sucat to Makati.

I pretended that I got on the wrong bus or pretended to fall asleep so I don't have to pay the transportation fare.

I skipped the jeep rides because I don't have any money to pay for that.

I bought cigarettes though, which wasn't a good idea.

I went to church even if I'm not religious because I want to give out fliers.

I posted my phone number in bulleting boards and advertised work from home opportunities so I can ask people to refer clients to me and I'll give them a share of my pay.

I don't have money to go on dates. I avoided seeing my friends at this time of my life.

I picked up a cellphone at a restaurant and instead of returning it, I kept it for myself, threw out the sim and eventually sold it so I'll have money for my expenses.

Everything I did was all a failure.

On my third month, I was in a meeting with the boss of the sales department.

They remind me that I'm on my third month in the company and I still have no sales.

Zero sales.

They wanted to know if I wanted to give up.

Real estate agents have a reputation of earning a lot of money 

They're ashamed to keep me because I'm a failure at sales and I'm broke.

I was given another 30 days.

The thirtieth day was on a Friday.

At 11:47 pm at a Starbucks in Makati, I received a reservation check from my client.

I got a sale on the final hour of my final day.

I made Php 90,000 from that sale.

My boss said, he'd take half of my commission check because I gave him a difficult transaction.

I didn't care.

I just wanted the sale.

I earned a total of Php 300k commission working for DMCI homes for six months.

My boss always asked for half of my commission for helping me. But that's for another story.
