Understanding Sales

Sales is an essential professional skill.

People who can sell make more money that people who can't sell.

Sales is also an important communication skill.

If you know how to sell and understand the principles of sales, you will never worry about not having a job.

If your sales skill level is high enough, you never have to worry about money for the rest of your life.

For people who grew up with families who own businesses, selling is a basic skill.

Selling is very much like a combination of a martial art and a language.

If you know how to sell, you have a GIANT advantage over people who don't know how to sell.

The more times you pracice, the better you become at sales.

I have friends who grew up in families that owned several businesses and selling is normal practice to them ever since they were young.

So when we got to start working, they were already comfortably earning six figure incomes while I was just learning how to sell.

This is very much like a comparrison of someone who's training to become an athlete starting from four to six years old and someone who got interested learning a sport in their twenties.

This is the reason why a lot of people feel defeated in sales.

The are "monsters" in sales but it's for a different reason.

Sales is like any skill.

It takes time to develop.

When you become fairly good it becomes extremely valuable.

There is no shame in failing as you learn sales.

You will use your sales skills until you get older.

You will only suck at sales if you quit.

This happens when you quit learning a skill.

Sales skills apply to getting a job.

Sales skills apply to earning MORE money.

Sales skills apply to making good friends.

Sales skills applies to relationships and family.

Sales skills applies to business.

Sales skills also apply to call center work.

That's why I'm teaching this skill.

In customer service and tech support, having a highe enough level in sales skills helps convince the customers to cooperate with your instructions.

You get higher customer service feedback.

You also get better AHT scores.

Your work also becomes less stressful overall because you understand sales princples.

## 1Sales Lessons

A person buys to make a gain or stop a pain.

People are looking for a benefit.

When you are trying to sell to someone, remind them of the benefit.

Other people buy because they arte looking for a solution to a problem.

What is stronger?

If a person is extremely logical, they want the benefit.

If the person is emotional, they want to stop the pain.

People who are capable of buying are usually okay.

They usually don't need to buy.

They buy because they just feel like it.

In a lot of situations, the gain is not strong enough motivation for people to take action.

99% follow a very specific way of thinking and living.

1% often do the opposite.

Sales Stories:

In 2005, I got hired at DMCI Homes as a sales agent.

I couldn't make a sale.

It's more painful because at the time, if you're a real estate agent and you don't make a sale, you don't have an allowance.

I recieved a 5k allowance.

My sales manager asked me to use that to pay for newspaper advertisements.

I used that money for advertisement.

I went to that job but didn't have any money for four months.

I used up all my money.

I borrowed money from my family.

Eventually, they stopped giving me money.

I still went to work.

I still handed out filers.

I went to all the parking lots in Makati that I could enter and left fliers on cars.

I gave filers at the malls and office buildings and got kicked out by the guards for not having a permit.

When I ran out of money, I convinced the nearby eatery to let me eat there for a few more days because I was just waiting for my pay.


I wasn't really expecting to get paid because I don't have a sale yet.

I lied to the bus conductor to ride from Sucat to Makati.

I pretended that I got on the wrong bus or pretended to fall asleep so I don't have to pay the transportation fare.

I skipped the jeep rides because I don't have any money to pay for that.

I bought cigarettes though, which wasn't a good idea.

I went to church even if I'm not religious because I want to give out fliers.

I posted my phone number in bulleting boards and advertised work from home opportunities so I can ask people to refer clients to me and I'll give them a share of my pay.

I don't have money to go on dates. I avoided seeing my friends at this time of my life.

I picked up a cellphone at a restaurant and instead of returning it, I kept it for myself, threw out the sim and eventually sold it so I'll have money for my expenses.

Everything I did was all a failure.

On my third month, I was in a meeting with the boss of the sales department.

They remind me that I'm on my third month in the company and I still have no sales.

Zero sales.

They wanted to know if I wanted to give up.

Real estate agents have a reputation of earning a lot of money 

They're ashamed to keep me because I'm a failure at sales and I'm broke.

I was given another 30 days.

The thirtieth day was on a Friday.

At 11:47 pm at a Starbucks in Makati, I received a reservation check from my client.

I got a sale on the final hour of my final day.

I made Php 90,000 from that sale.

My boss said, he'd take half of my commission check because I gave him a difficult transaction.

I didn't care.

I just wanted the sale.

I earned a total of Php 300k commission working for DMCI homes for six months.

My boss always asked for half of my commission for helping me. But that's for another story.
