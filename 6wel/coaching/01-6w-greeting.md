## Prepare for the Coaching

Go get your notebook.

We will discuss your answers to the writing exercises.

If you have a headset, go get it.

## Get Feedback

How was your experience with the writing exercises?

What's your favorite part?

What do you like about that part?

What's your least favorite part?

What's the most difficult question?

Why do you think that's important?

What do you think is the reason why I asked you to do all the writing activities?

Why are detailed stories and complete instructions important parts of communication skills?

Now that you've completed all seven lessons, what's the most important lesson that you've learned so far for week one?

## W1L1

We are going to go through Week 1 Lesson 1.

I'm going to read through your answers.

I will give you some feedback and corrections.

Please have a pen and your notebook ready.

## Quick Review

I want you to express yourself and be talkative on paper.

I want your answers to be as long as possible.

We want you to give long answers from week 1 to week 3 and week 4 onward we will slowly shorten your answers.

I also want you to use the one sentence paragraph format.

I want you to write shorter sentences.

I want you to use simple words.

I want you to do your best to be as specific and detailed as possible.

I want you to read both the questions and answers aloud.

That's all you need.

Internally, you know how to correct your grammar because you already have over ten repeats of English lessons from parts of speech to grammar rules.

## Recording

Do your best to write notes.

If I'm going too fast, let me know and I'll slow down.

I'm also recording this so I can give you a record.

When I post this, it will be private.

After you watch this and you like it and you're okay with me sharing this, please give me a go signal.

If the session is good we may inspire other students.

## Interview Activity

There are different interviewers.

Different interviewers will have different interests.

Shortly after you give introductions you will be asked to tell a story about your answers.

Interviewer: Why should I hire you?

Applicant: I'm honest, hard-working, dependable, flexible and humble.

Interviwer: Tell me a story about a time when you had to choose between a personal appointment and a work commitment. You're on your way to a special event and your employer asked you to go to work and miss your personal event.

**If you say flexible:**

Tell me about a time where you had to work on a task that is not part of your job description.

I like to listen outside the interview room so I can get more ideas on how other people answer interview questions.

Interviewer: How do you spend your free time?

Applicant: I am making a lot of effort to improve my English communication skills so I watch a lot of English movies and read a lot of English books.

Interviwer: That's impressive. What's the title of your favorite English Movie?

Applicant: Says the title of a popular movie.

Interviwer: I always wanted to see that movie but never got the chance to. Please tell me a short story about that movie.

Applicant: No answer.

The applicant does not get hired.

Pause.

Do you feel the applicant is lying in this situation?

I believe that in a lot of situations, Filipino applicants tell the truth during interviews.

The main problem is they remember 90% of the story in Tagalog.

What's your favorite English song?

If I gave you five minutes, can you translate that song into Filipino?

In an interview, you only get thirty seconds to translate your story and tell it to the interviewer.

Poorly translated stories don't sound good.

It is filled with uhms, ahhs, grammar errors, incomlete thoughts and everything else that makes you sound like a poor communicator.

That's the main reason why we do the writing exercises.

If you want to become spontaneous, you need to know the script by heart.

In the writing exercises, we are writing your script.

If you want to sound great, your script needs to be well written.

I have a question for you.

Six weeks preparation for a sixty minute interview.

That's 1,000 times preparation if you multiply 24 by 42.

Do you feel that's a waste of time?

Do you know who else puts in 1,000 times the work for a short performance?

Do you watch movies?

Do you know that it takes 1-2 years to put together a movie?

How long is one movie?

Do you play or watch sports?

Do you know that athletes train six months to a year to compete?

How long is a fight or a sport competition?

Are you aware that doctors make a lot of money?

Are you aware that doctors stay in school for ten years or more?

Do you know that top people in the business world do the same thing?

Here's my question for you.

Do you want to be top level or do you want to depend on luck for your career?

That's how we start.

We allow you to write your thoughts, experience and short stories on your notebook and writing exercises.

If you do this, you'll increase your skills and qualify for higher paying jobs.

## 5 Years From Now

This is preparation for these two questions:

1. Where do you see yourself five years from now?
2. What is your expected salary.

These two questions usually go together.

Your 5 years from now goal should match your monthly salary.

An new call center agent makes 20-25k a month.

A more tenured agent makes 25k to 30k+ a month.

If you add that for five years, the most you can earn is â‚±2,200,000.

Some people they will say, I want a house, a car and travel the world five years from now.

Do you see yourself getting all three in five years with this amount of money?

Exactly.

Your goals need to be well thought of.

You want to think about your life, what you want to happen and build your career plan based on what you want your life to happen.

You want to be specific with your target income and savings goals.

If you don't know the answers to these questions, you will fall victim to lowballer interviews.
