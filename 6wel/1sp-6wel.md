When writing in longer formats, I believe that using one sentence paragraphs will improve your communication skill as it did mine.

I realized last year that if I keep my paragraph size to one sentence, writing becomes 1,000 times easier.

So I use the one sentence paragraph format all the time.

I keep most of my writing, both personal and professional, in the one sentence paragraph format.

It makes writing easier.

I write one sentence per line.

I have a full space at the top of the paragraph.

I also have a full space at the bottom of the paragraph.

In other words, I add a full line after each period.

If I’m working on paper, this gives me the opportunity to add missing details to the spaces.

Then I edit.

Usually by reading what I have written out loud.

Sometimes I use a voice recorder app on my phone or just use the video recorder feature on my camera.

I listen to how it sounds and pay attention to potential errors.

Then I write down my corrections.

I ask myself the following questions:

**Does the sentence make sense?**

**Does the sentence sound good?**

**Does the sentence sound the same way that I talk?**

**Can I make the sentence shorter?**

**Are there any words that I can remove?**

**Are there technical terms that I can simplify or explain in a simple way?**

**Have I removed the following vague or unspecific words?**

- **This** (use the specific thing you are referring to)
- **That** (use the specific thing you are referring to)
- **Them** (use the specific person you are referring to)
- **There** (use the specific place you are referring to)
- **These** (use the specific items that you are referring to)
- **It** (use the specific thing you are referring to)
- **Something** (use the specific thing you are referring to)
- **Someone** (use the specific person you are referring to)
- **Other pronouns that make what you're saying unspecific**.

There are times where you can break these rules but most of the time, you can use the above rules and get good results.

You will benefit greatly from being as specific as possible with your communication.

That’s because you end up not leaving anything to interpretation and be able to say exactly what you want to say.

## Benefits of using one sentence paragraphs

One sentence paragraphs make it extremely easy for me to find errors and make the appropriate fix.

I can easily compose.

If I’m writing on paper, one sentence paragraph makes it easy for me to fix errors.

If I’m writing on the computer, editing and moving text around becomes incredibly easy.

Depending on what I am writing and who I am writing for, using the one sentence paragraph, also makes it easy to make a topic longer or shorter.

## One sentence paragraphs make it easy to read on a computer.

If I’m trying to understand a topic that I don’t understand, I copy the article, lesson or message to a text editor and convert the text into a one text paragraph.

Then I try to understand the difficult lesson one sentence at a time.

The one sentence paragraph is a practice that I’ve been doing to my newer lessons.

Adding space between the sentence is a really small change to my approach but has made me a better writer overall.

This lesson is written in a one sentence paragraph format.

## Activity

Using a one sentence paragraph format, write or rewrite the following on your notebook:

**The story of your greatest accomplishment.**

**The story of how you overcome your weakness.**

**The story of how you learned your favorite skill.**

**Instructions on how to use your favorite skill.** (For example cook your favorite food)

**Instructions on how to commute to a call center.**

**Instructions on your advice on how to solve a problem.**

**The story of why you wanted to work in a call center.**

**What’s your dream income and your plan to reach that dream income.**

Please complete two of these over the weekend.

Please complete all of these over the six week lessons because your answers to these questions are likely going to be used during your job application.
