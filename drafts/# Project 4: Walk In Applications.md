## Project 4: Walk In Applications

When I was younger walk in applications are my favorite method of getting a job.

I do a quick research on what 

I do my best to have 2 or more interviews a day (ideally, one in the morning and one in the afternoon) for a month to get hired as soon as I can.

If I have an interview scheduled in the area, I do a google search and ask friends if they know other companies close to the area and I walkin.

If you are able to maintain doing two job applications a day, you can get to complete sixteen job interview in two weeks.
