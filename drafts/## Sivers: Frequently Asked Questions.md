### Sivers: Frequently Asked Questions
2016-12-22






First master HTML and CSS, as described in “Should you learn programming? Yes.”

Then learn JavaScript, as described in “How to learn JavaScript”.

If you just want to get a job or make a website, you can ignore the curiosity about other languages. Just master JavaScript, and it will take you far.

But if you still find programming fascinating, make a point of learning the basics of three or four other vastly different languages, like SQL, Python, and Racket, because something clicks once you understand a few different ways of getting the end result you want. You don’t need to master them. Just spend a month with each, going through a couple tutorial books about it, and making something happen with it.

Definitely read “The Pragmatic Programmer”, no matter what.

How do I become a better writer?
First read “On Writing Well”.

Then read “Made to Stick”.

Write publicly every week. Post it somewhere people see it. Something changes when your writing is out in the public, being seen by strangers. Seeing it through their eyes helps more than anything.

Will you read or review my book?
I don’t review books.

I only read for my own self-improvement, based on my own needs at the time, then take notes for my own reflection.

I’m a musician. What should I do?
Read “How To Make It in the New Music Business” by Ari Herstand, and do what he says.

This is the single best book on the current music business. An absolute must-read for every musician.

Blah blah blah blah CD Baby?
I left CD Baby in 2008. I haven’t talked with anyone there since then. I don’t even know who works there anymore.

I know nothing about what they’re doing. So I have no insights and no opinions.

What should I do about my relationship, or lack of?
Read “Models” by Mark Manson. (Only guys ask me for relationship advice.)

I’m really sad.
Read “When Things Fall Apart” by Pema Chödrön.
