Hi there.

I have a very important question for you. 

How much income are you losing today?

You might not think that you are losing money.

But you are.


If your income is limited by your experience and education 


You are losing out because there are better opportunities around you than what you currently have.



In fact there are more opportunities that for a higher pay than what you think.

There are more opportunities here then going abroad.

My favorite example is the BPO industry.

The BPO industry has millions of jobs being offered and they pay 

Way more than minimum wage.

Way more what most Filipinos are used to earning.

The BPO industry is one of my favorite opportunities because it has the most number of open opportunities daily.

 They are always hiring.

 They always have jobs being offered at higher positions.

 They pay above the standard local rate.

 They pay on time.

 It has the least ampunt of hassles.


Most Filipino's I've talked to are willing to accept minimum wage.


Or even less than that.

I hear it's "better than not having a job."

With.

Zero Income.

Because that hurts the family.

But with many reputable BPO companies.

Even the smallest companies pay better than minimum wage.

Many pay really well.






However 

Very few people are qualified.

To get hired 

and that's a simple fact.


Now even if small call centers pay above minimum-wage.

And there are already hundreds of thousands of Filipinos who are enjoying this income. 

You're probably 

not getting hired in a BPO 

because 

number one your English is not good enough

or 

number two 

your confidence level is not high enough 

now 

the real reason I think is or the major cause of the problem is you don't have call-center knowledge 

if you did have call center knowledge than you would be making decisions about your life differently 

the biggest problem is you don't know 

and because you don't know you're missing out on what is possible 

now everybody knows that call-center work pays well to the people who have the skills 

now the question is why are are you not getting the skills?

why do you have problems with learning English? 

why do you have problems with your confidence? 

what's wrong with that? 

now I don't believe that the standard Filipino person does not have a good English

 and I don't believe that the standard Filipino person does not have confidence 

 let me give are you two examples 

 for the English I studied here in the Philippines 


 I study locally and I do not have like I am currently 30 years but so that means that I am not included in the whole K-12 think

 so that means so I had like Kinder Prep Grade one of the grade 6 and then after grade 6 I got four years in high school and then I went to college 

 Now if if you are if you did take Grade One to grade 6 and you had first year before if your hi school then that means you have 10 years of education

 You have 10 years english at least one hour a day 

 because each subject is each subject is one hour 

 so if you were to multiply that that's extra number of school days Avenue and that's x number of hours by 10 years you have an insanely large number of practicing English 

 and other than that if you watch TV if you've had TV if you use the Internet you've used Facebook you've used YouTube you've used any of these technologies. 

 They are all in English so that means you already have a working knowledge in English 

 so that I am the problem is if if you're if you go to an interview in the interviewer asks you to say something in English 

 then you're stuck 

 you're not introducing yourself or properly 

 You're not telling the right stories 

 you're not asking the right questions 
and 

 that's that's the problem when you go  to a call center interview 

you're not going to get hired.

 the same thing with confidence 

 I don't believe that Filipinos do not have confidence 

 if you if you look at local channels 

 then the Filipinos who join the all these game shows 

 all these a song and dance variety shows 

 these Filipinos to try do you join like a Filipino got talent heard those kind of things these people have confidence 

 and I'm sure you do I'm sure at one point you were confident 

 if you have a girlfriend or a boyfriend 

 it took confidence to introduce yourself and to get that person to get that person to pay attention to you

 And get that person to be part of your life 


that requires confidence 
To get to where you are it required confidence as well 


now confidence is not a problem 

OK 

the  problem there is call center knowledge 

if you don't have a call center knowledge 

then you wouldn't you wouldn't know what to focus on 

now I've talked to a lot of people 

and they say 

Kevin I'm going to practice on my own 

and yeah they do 

so what happens  

let's say my friend  Mark wants to practice English 

on his own s

o what does Mark do? 

Marke tells me

 I'm going to read the dictionary 

 Now the dictionary has thousands of words 

by the time you're finished reading the dictionary 

you've already wasted so much time 

what's the what's another approach I've heard?

Michael tells me I'm going to read English books.

In fact if you go to a call center training. That's what they're going to ask you to do.

Read English books. 

What kind of English books I ask?

He said it doesn't matter we have a lot of English books at home.

Patrick tells me he's going to read the newspaper.

Anna tells me she's going to watch a lot of English movies.


A question I get asked often is what kind of English books do I read.

If the plan is to use School text books or grade school textbooks for high school in these books do not help you because you already have 10 years of experience going through those books and your English is still like that and that's a problem if your English is not good 

then that's it you're done 

you go to an interview 

interview were asked you to talk about yourself 

and then you're done t

here's nothing there 

there's nothing and then Mark says oh well in that case I'm going to try and read the newspaper not that's not gonna help the newspapers boring I don't know I don't have that for me the newspaper story I read it and then I fall sleep 

If your income is limited by your education and experiences.

You are losing out.

There are better opportunities than what you know.

There are better opportunities than going abroad.

There are better opportunities than what your parents have told you.

The BPO has created an opportunity for millions of jobs.

But very few are qualified workers.

There are more jobs but there are not enough skilled filipinos.

One problem is skill level.

The bigger problem is ambition.

The thing people fail to realize is that skill can be improved.

The problem is ambition.

You often hear the declaration.

I can't do it.

Well everyone has our own...

I can't do it.

But.

Some people they ask themselves.

What's stopping me?

No education? No money? No knowledge?

What's the solution to these things?

Education? Buy a book? Pay a tutor?

No money? Save money? Sacrifice a few things to afford something important?


No knowledge? Research the internet? Buy a book.


If you’re new here, my name is Kevin and I write the lessons here and maintain this site.

Many small BPO companies pay above minimum wage

And

Thousands of Filipinos are already enjoying this income

And you are not.

Because:

You are not good at English.

or

You have no confidence. 

The real reason is you don't have call center knowledge.

The biggest problem is you don't know.

And because you don't know you are missing out on what's possible.

Everybody know's that the call center industry pays well to the people who have the skills.

Why don't you have the skills?

How much money are you losing today

The attempt to get better

This site has hundreds of hours of lessons and activities that you can read and learn from.

In terms of training I offer intensive training for a fee and free self-study training through this blog.

I hope you benefit and enjoy it as much as I enjoyed putting it together.

Here are the top articles that you should read if you want to get hired in a call center.


### The Basics How To Succeed In Life and Call Center Work

Anything you need to know can be learned.

English is a skill.

People skills are a skill.

Salesmanship is a skill.

Skills can be learned.

Nobody is born with skills.

People who are good at specific skills spend time, practice, made mistakes, learned and got better over time.

The first attempt often looks silly.

For things to change you need to change.

If I don't change, my situation will stay the same.

Those who succeed are positive about finding solutions to their problems.

Negative people are passionate about how impossible it is to find solutions to their problems.

There are only one or two things that I need to work on and all I need to do is to get it right and then repeat that the few times and then the habit forms and eventually it becomes permanent.

The best way to learn is by doing.

Mistakes can be corrected.

A failure is an event not the person.

I can fail many times but I am never a failure.

If I fail, there is something wrong with my technique not with myself.

There are people who have done this (my goal) before and if they can do it I can do it too.

God has blessed me with all that I have and the ability to get better every day.

Nothing is instant everything in nature grow slowly.

There are no shortcuts.

I will continue to get better until I reach my goal.

Luck means preparation meeting opportunity.

I will give no excuse because an excuse is a lie that I tell myself justify why I did not get what I want.

In the event that I feel or am at a loss what to do next I will always remember that "the answer is always there and I just haven't found it yet."

Knowing this I will continue to search for the answer and I will not stop until I find it.

#### You Don't Need To Wait For Me

I"m honored that people ask me for tips on how to get hired. You actually don"t need me to get hired. You don"t need to wait for me to teach you. You don"t need me to write your resume. You don"t need to me to answer your question.

When I was younger I used to believe I need somebody to succeed. At times I would wait for weeks, months, even years to get to convince somebody to help me. Things never turned out as planned.

Got a friend who said he will refer you to their company? You can go there yourself.

Got a question you"re waiting for an answer? Google it or you can find out yourself.

Waiting for a response to an email application? Walk in randomly.

Didn"t know how your interview went? Ask the interviewer where you sucked at and ask for tips. When I got used to this, I asked as much questions as I could, extending my interview time to 30 minutes and sometimes an hour. One time the interviewer decided to recommend me for a job offer after just answering my questions.

The last one took the most courage. It also gave me the ability to go to the next interview

Ask your best friend to practice English with you. Tell them to write down every time you made a mistake or said something that didn"t make sense. Discuss the alternatives.

It"s an honor to be asked all these questions but I"m not always online. I have other things going on in my life. I also have [another blog](https://kevinolega.com). I also [travel around](https://philippineislandliving.com). I wrote the tips on this site to answer questions for people so I don"t need to answer them one by one per person.

If you"re asking for some tips please read my tips first and ask for specifics in case I missed out on some details.

Write your own guide. Borrow from the lessons you picked up from this site.

Don"t use lack of something (information or skills) as an excuse for inaction. Instead ask yourself, if I never got (what you are waiting for) what do I do to get what I want?

My answer or whatever you are waiting for won"t bring you closer to your goals. Your first steps will. Go ahead and start don"t wait for me.
