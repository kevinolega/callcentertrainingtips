**TRAINING SUMMARY:**

You’re not new to work.

You show up, meet deadlines, and try to stay out of trouble.

But you’re stuck.

No raise. No promotion. No better offer.

Sometimes the person who speaks better—even if they work less—gets ahead.

If you struggle to explain your strengths, lead conversations, or speak with confidence, you’ll keep getting overlooked.

This training helps you speak clearly, sound more professional, and finally sell yourself.
