Call Center Training Tips started as a list of tips on how to pass call center interviews, shared with four friends and grew into an extraordinary blog, a book and a [Facebook community](http://facebook.com/callcentertrainingtips/). 

I'm Kevin and I have been working on the lessons for seven years. I have been publishing the lessons since 2012 and this had reached thousands of Filipinos who want to work in a call center.

[My lessons have helped hundreds of Filipinos get hired in a call center](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/testimonials).

Several hundred Filipinos had sent me letters and messages, thanking and informing me of their success, that they are already hired in a call center. Some readers went as far as sent me gifts and donations to help keep this blog running.

Some readers have hired me to assist them get better results in their job application or promotion interviews.

I spend several hours every week publishing new lessons, refining and adjusting old lessons, asking and answering questions, sharing interesting thoughts on the facebook page, or senfing messages on my free online lessons newsletter.

This blog has a lot of stories and lessons that had changed my life.

I originally wrote the lessons on this blog to help some friends get hired in a call center. I thought, instead of explaining how to get hired for a few others to each one, I decided to just write the lessons down.

This website was designed with shy Filipinos in mind. Most of my friends, including myself are introverts.

A few years ago I accompanied friends to interviews and give them ideas on how to improve until they got hired. 

It normally takes us 4-6 call centers until they get hired. 

When they get hired, we go for pizza and they buy me a few beers after.

In 2005 I worked for a call center training school. I assisted students with the enrollment process and gave additional coaching upon graduation.

Over the years, the mistakes, experience, studies and questions led me to accumulate a massive amount of lessons.

You'll find lessons on how to improve confidence, speak better English, present well during interviews and job hunting strategies.

I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute my experience with you and I'm excited that you'll pick up something useful.

I hope you enjoy reading and learning as I much as I enjoyed writing and putting this website together.

### Some Common Questions

**Who are your readers?**

Shy Filipinos mostly. Male, Female, between 18 and 40 years old. Many of them want to work in a call center, some want to read up or connect with someone for English lessons. I decided to write the lessons on the website that I wanted to read. 

The website that I wish existed when I started looking for work.

**What is the best way to ask for your help?**

You can start by the most recent tip you've read. What did you do with it? What happened and tell me about specific questions you might have. General questions like "can you give me some tips" pissed me off at first. These days I refer them to the basics page on this blog.

**Who pays for all this?**

I do. Every now and then someone asks me to assist them with their application and offers to treat me to coffee and pay me some money. I use the money to pay for this website's maintenance. I spend some buying books on learning and teaching.

**What kind of help do you need?**

I need a little help paying for the site. Hosting costs have increased over the years and I also pay someone to check my posts and assist with the editing. I'd love to get a new design for the site. I hope someone this site has helped gets to read this and consider contacting me to make a contribution.

## My Call Center Training Credentials 

I helped grow a call center training school in Quezon City, Makati, and Ortigas.

Eventually the company opened their own small call center in Ortigas. Unfortunately, the owner of the company went to the States and the school closed down.

I helped build the initial program and did research on how to find work in a call center from back in 2005 when I was asked to apply at well known call centers in order to learn the recruitment process and to understand how to qualify for a call center position.

I then further tried to improve and found a way to put what I learned to good use by teaching and giving tips to friends who are looking for work in a call center.

I did this for about two years and I’ve been giving away these tips for about four years already.

I am not an English major. I am not a communications graduate. I only have about a year of work experience at several call centers and just two years of work in a call center training school. I only had one year of college, which is a blessing because call centers accept high school graduates and only a handful of strict ones require two years or a degree in college.

I learn about things through research and experience and the help of people better than me.

What I offer is just me sharing my experience on how me and my colleagues and friends were able to help several Filipinos find work in a call center.

I am not an expert in grammar, pronunciation or accents. My skill is just slightly above average. I can teach you a bit about it but its not as comprehensive as classes done by college professors.

My training focuses more on building confidence while speaking in English, correcting common grammar and pronunciation mistakes, basics of call center work, and preparing for call center interviews.

At the moment I am not charging anything for access to this site and the free weekend training I do at our house. I do it as a hobby and to help a few friends. I opened it up for other people to make friends and because I enjoy helping Filipinos find work. I also enjoy teaching either in person or through my writing.

I would also like to make money from this activity in the future but for now, I would like to just offer this service for free as part of my helping others/charity activities.

If you’re good with that, you’re invited to participate by either reading the contents of this site or sending me a message for free lessons.

**UPDATE 2013:** 

I eventually worked in a call center. I have been working in a call center for three years. In my first year I almost failed regularization. My new boss told me that my previous boss recommended me for termination. He didn't stop there though. He helped me identify my strengths and overcome my weaknesses and eventually I got regularized. The next month I was awarded top agent for customer feedback. The following year I was awarder top agent again for the most number of repair calls converted into sales. Using the same method my boss taught me, I just got really better at what I did. If you're interested I can also teach you. Just send me a message.

**Update 2017:** 

I have left the call center after three years. I was top agent twice and was classified super agent for the day.I now work from home taking care of foreign clients with their business. I used the call center money to buy the computers I need for a home based work setup, I bought the tools to build a beautiful kitchen, I bought a few bikes to take care of my transportation and I enrolled at CrossFit to help manage my depression.

**Update 2019:**

I'm still working remotely (from anywhere). Some days, I work from home, some days, I connect from a computer shop. Some days, I rent an office. I still work out and I'm working on improving my sleep and my health further. I eat a meat-only diet.
