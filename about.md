Call Center Training Tips is the largest collection of lessons about call center career advice.

Originally shared with four friends, this website grew into my personal library of career advice.

The goal is to inspire friends to build professional skills that will allow you to achieve your dream income.

I decided to write the lessons on the website that I wanted to read. 

The website that I wish existed when I started looking for work.

We also have a [Facebook community](http://facebook.com/callcentertrainingtips/). 

I'm Kevin and I have been helping friends get hired in a call center since 2005 and I began publishing my lessons in 2012.

[My lessons already helped hundreds of Filipinos get hired in a call center](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/testimonials).

Several hundred Filipinos had sent me letters and messages, thanking and informing me of their success, that they are already hired in a call center. 

Some readers went as far as sent me gifts and donations to help keep this website running.

Some readers have hired me to assist them get better results in their job application or promotion interviews.

I spend several hours every week writing and publishing new lessons.

I read everything again and again so I can refine and adjust the old lessons.

I ask and answer questions on my notebook.

I share my most interesting thoughts here and on the on the Facebook page.

This website contains a lot of lessons and stories that changed my life.

I originally wrote the lessons on this website to help some friends get hired in a call center. 

I was thinking that instead of explaining how to get hired for a few hours to each friend one by one, I decided to just write the lessons down.

This website was designed with shy Filipinos in mind. 

Most of my friends, including myself are introverts.

A few years ago I accompanied friends to interviews and give them ideas on how to improve until they got hired. 

It normally takes us 4-6 call centers until they get hired. 

When they get hired, we go for pizza and they buy me a few beers after.

In 2005, I worked for a call center training school. 

I assisted students with the enrollment process and gave additional coaching upon graduation.

Over the years, the mistakes, experience, studies and questions led me to accumulate a massive amount of lessons.

You'll find lessons on how to improve confidence, speak better English, present well during interviews and job hunting strategies on this website.

I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute my experience with you and I'm excited that you'll pick up something useful.

I hope you enjoy reading and learning as I much as I enjoyed writing and putting this website together.

## My Call Center Training Credentials 

I helped grow a call center training school in Quezon City, Makati, and Ortigas.

Eventually the company opened their own small call center in Ortigas. 

Unfortunately, the owner of the company went to the States and the school closed down.

I helped build the initial program and did research on how to find work in a call center from back in 2005 when I was asked to apply at well known call centers in order to learn the recruitment process and to understand how to qualify for a call center position.

I then further tried to improve and found a way to put what I learned to good use by teaching and giving tips to friends who are looking for work in a call center.

I did this for about two years and Iâ€™ve been giving away these tips for over ten years already.

I am not an English major. 

I am not a communications graduate. 

I only have four years of call center work experience and two years of assisting in the call center training school. 

I only had one year of college, which is a blessing because several call centers accept high school graduates and only a handful of strict ones require two years or a degree in college.

I'm a kinesthetic learner so I learn about things through active research, personal experience and the help of people better than me.

What I offer on this website is my personal experience on how I helped myself and a few friends get hired in a call center and other high paying jobs by improving their communication skills.

I am not an expert in grammar, pronunciation or accents but I've improved mine to a point where nobody complains about it.

I spent the last fifteen years working in jobs that require high level communication skills as a primary requirement. 

I teach how I communicate and the story behind my techniques.

My training focuses on building confidence while speaking in English, correcting common grammar and pronunciation mistakes, basics of call center work, and preparing for call center interviews.

You can read all the lessons here for free.

This is my primary form of community service.

### UPDATE 2013:

I eventually worked in a call center. I have been working in a call center for three years. In my first year I almost failed regularization. My new boss told me that my previous boss recommended me for termination. He didn't stop there though. He helped me identify my strengths and overcome my weaknesses and eventually I got regularized. The next month, I was awarded top agent for customer feedback. The following year I was awarder top agent again for the most number of repair calls converted into sales. Using the same method my boss taught me, I just got really better at what I did. If you're interested I can also teach you. Just send me a message.

### Update 2017:

I have left the call center after three years. I was top agent twice and was classified super agent for the day.I now work from home taking care of foreign clients with their business. I used the call center money to buy the computers I need for a home based work setup, I bought the tools to build a beautiful kitchen, I bought a few bikes to take care of my transportation and I enrolled at CrossFit to help manage my depression.

### Update 2019:

I'm still working remotely (from anywhere). Some days, I work from home, some days, I connect from a computer shop. Some days, I rent an office. I still work out and I'm working on improving my sleep and my health further. I eat a meat-only diet.

### Update 2020:

Last December, we launched a six week English learning program and attracted hundreds of studens. I spend half my day sending lessons, helping my students improve their communication skills and giving career advice.

I have more free time to write.
