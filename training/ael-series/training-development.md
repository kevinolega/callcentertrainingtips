<h2>REMINDERS</h2>

    <summary>Read more</summary>

<p>Please read all the lessons and instructions carefully.</p>
<p>Please answer all activities.</p>
<p>Please follow the one-sentence paragraph format when you submit your answers. </p>
<p>The one-sentence paragraph format is explained in the lessons Removing Bad Habits and Lesson 6 One-Sentence Paragraph.</p>
<p>The minimum number of sentences for most of the writing exercises is fifteen sentences.</p>
<p>We record a video of your phone coaching session for training purposes.</p>
<p>We publish some of the coaching sessions to our YouTube channel.</p>
<p>We'll inspect your answers one sentence at a time during the coaching session.</p>
<p>We would like to avoid publishing our student's private information.</p>
<p>Please do not include personal info like your complete name, and complete address in your answers.</p>
<p>Your first name or nickname is fine for all of our questions.</p>
<p>Do not say: My name is James Kevin Olega. You may call me Kevin for short.</p>
<p>Instead say: My name is Kevin.</p>
<p>Do not say: I live in 123 Paper Street BF Homes Sucat Parañaque City.</p>
<p>Say: I live in Parañaque City.</p>
<p>The second example sounds more confident.</p>
<p>Please remember to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Follow the One Sentence Paragraph Format</li>
    <li>Shorten your sentences. Your sentence needs to have only one idea.</li>
    <li>Write complete sentences.</li>
    <li>Run your answers through a spelling and grammar check program. We use <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a>.</li>
    <li>Read your answers aloud before submitting.</li>
    <li>Use simple words.</li>
    <li>Always ask yourself the questions: Does this sentence express exactly what I want to say? How can I say this sentence better?</li>
    <li>Translate your sentences whenever you are stuck. Write your thoughts in Filipino, then English, so you could compare the two versions to see if you have a clear message. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>English became more exhibition instead of communication back in junior and senior high school.</strong></p>
<p>Your English needs to focus on communication instead of exhibition to succeed as a professional.</p>
<p>Your goal is to convey simple messages that are easy to understand.</p>
<p><strong>AVOID:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Big paragraphs.</li>
    <li>Compound, complex, and long, compound-complex sentences.</li>
    <li>Fancy or complicated words.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our goal is to reinforce your understanding of the basic rules.</p>
<p>You can go back to adding flair to your communication after you've mastered the basics.</p>
<p>Please read REMOVING BAD HABITS as many times as you need.</p>
<p>Send us an email for questions.</p>

    <p>What to do while waiting.</p>   
    <p>Sometimes the coaching schedule gets filled up.</p>
    <p>We prepared some additional activities for you.</p>
    <p>While waiting for your phone coaching schedule, begin watching our recorded sessions with other students.</p>
    <p>We provide a wealth of information during phone coaching.</p>
    <p>The more questions you ask, the more answers we can give you.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, we don’t always have the time to cover all the questions and sometimes we forget to cover something that you want to know.</p>
    <p>We recommend that you list down all your questions so we can answer all those at the end of the session.</p>
    <p>The good news is you receive the benefit other students receive because all the sessions are recorded.</p>
    <p>Click the links to watch the other sessions and discover the challenges of other people and what solutions we came with together.</p>
    <p>The more you understand about how we solve the problems together the better your problem solving skills become.</p>
    <p>Your problem solving skills get better as you understand how we solve different problems.</p>
    <p>Higher level communication skills become available as a consequence of heightened problem solving skills.</p>
