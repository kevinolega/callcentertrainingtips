## My Third Month as a Freelance Writer

When I got hired as a writer, I made $1 for every 100 words that I've written.

Many of the articles that I've written are between 300 to 500 words.

I made $3 for a 300-word article.

I made $5 for a 500-word article.

I wrote at a speed of one sentence per minute.

I estimate that each sentence is approximately 3-5 words.

If I worked for two hours a day and completed two short articles, I earned $6 that day.

I made an extra $120 that month.

If that's the only money I made that year, that's $1,440 at the end of the year.

$6 is worth Php 300.

$120 is worth Php 6,000.

$1,440 is Php 72,000.

If I kept my call center job, wrote for two hours a day, and saved the money that I earned writing short articles, I would have an additional Php 72,000 at the end of the year.
