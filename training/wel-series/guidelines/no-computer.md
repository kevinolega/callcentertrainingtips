I started working in 2005 and began writing my thoughts consistently in 2007.

I was only writing in my notebook. 

That's all I could afford at the time.

I didn't own a computer until 2012.

I didn't own a smartphone until 2014.

During our Christmas Party, I asked the person who picked my name in the exchange gift to buy me a USB stick so I can save my writing.

I used the USB to save my files if the computer doesn't have an internet connection.

I later discovered that I can save my writing to Dropbox, SimpleNote, Evernote, and Google Drive.

I borrowed computers from my roommates. 

I tell them I just need to encode something for thirty minutes. 

Some of them give me more time.

Whenever I got the chance, I visited friends and family members.

 I asked for permission to encode something using their computer.

If I really didn't have access to a computer, I went to a computer shop and typed away.

It was a little harder, everyone was playing DOTA, but I know that what I'm doing is going to help build a better future for me.

I worked in a call center from 2013 to 2016.

I got a job as a writer.

I got a job as a virtual assistant.

I also took a part-time job managing a small gym.

I later got promoted as a project manager.

I feel that all my efforts writing has made an enormous contribution to my career progress.
