If you don't have access to a laptop here's what you can do.

Write your answers on your notebook.

Please write both the questions and the answers.

Label your answers with a Title and Page Number to make your answers more organized.

Snap a photo using a scanner app. (I use Google Keep or Google Drive)

Attach the images to a Google Document.

Your answers will be more organized.

You can add labels and type in additional details.

Then you can just share the link and I'll be able to view it.

One problem I encounter with my students is when they take photos, the file is too big.

Email can attach a maximum of 25mb per email.

That's 4-5 photos if your camera is high quality.

What's the solution?

Upload the photos into a Google Document.

Use the share link to share.

I'll discuss the details in the video.

Please watch the video until the end.

Here's a video about how I handle multiple photos.
