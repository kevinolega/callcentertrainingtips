How do you deal with questions you don't understand?

	This is another truth bomb.

Some instructions are not clear.

That was intentional.

When working with professionals, we all do our best to give the best with our communication.

We are still people, though.

We make mistakes.

We work with people who get what we need.

We work with people who don't get what we need.

There are also people with low skill levels.

That's part of your test.

This test is one of the most important tests because this situation happens all the time.

It tests your character.

It tests your communication skills.

If you don't understand, your response reveals your character.

What do you do if you have a low skill level?

You practice humility.

I learned a bad habit in school.

I would keep silent about what I don't understand. 

Using my silence, I would pretend I understood everything and hope I don't get asked about it.

I don't want to look stupid.

I don't want people to tell me that I'm stupid for not understanding simple instructions.

I would also hope that the consequences wouldn't prevent me from moving to the next stage.

I graduated but with low grades.

So somehow, I applied the habit outside of school.

I learned the hard way (getting yelled at, suspended, and fired) that I should always ask questions when I don't understand.

I also experienced being on the other end.

When I'm screening applicants with my boss, if an applicant did any of the following:

- didn't follow instructions 
- didn't ask any questions
- guessed and gave the wrong answer

We tag these applicants as not qualified.

I rarely assume anything at work.

So this is also part of your test.

If you went silent because you don't understand something, it's your fault.

But I'm giving you another chance.

If you're humble enough to speak up, even if you look stupid, that's worth it.

It looks more stupid to repeatedly lose opportunities because you fail to answer a basic question that you didn't understand.

It's also stupid expensive.

If there's a part that wasn't clear, you should ask questions.

You should try to research it too. 

Research is part of your test.

Don't try to guess the answers.

Don't invent fake answers.

Dishonesty can get you fired.

If you fail to learn this skill while practicing with me, the same problem will appear in your career.

Unless you have low ambitions and you'd like to stay in a low-paying job for the rest of your life.

1. You're supposed to read carefully and make an effort to understand.

2. You're supposed to research the parts you don't understand.

3. You're supposed to ask for help.

If you have any questions, let's talk.

We are here for you.
