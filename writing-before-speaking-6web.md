I’m an introvert.

You can recognize I am a shy person immediately after you meet me.

I trained myself to become an extrovert.

I read somewhere that extroverts get paid better.

Extroverts receive more benefits and more opportunities than introverts.

I spent a lot of time thinking about it.

The idea that extroverts are able to receive more higher paying opportunities makes sense.

People rarely go out of their way to ask you questions about you.

Are you comfortable talking about interests?

Are you used to talking about your skills?

Do you have a detailed list of your past accomplishments?

Can you effortlessly propose your potential contributions?

Do you find it easy to ask other people for opportunities?

Do you always get help when things get difficult?

If you don’t ask, you don’t get.

Successful people in business and the professional world ask for opportunities, support, money and assistance, **ALMOST ALL THE TIME**.

If you live your life not asking for anything, you're screwed.

The extroverts take all the opportunities before you get the chance to.

There are a lot of opportunities.

However, it's important to remember that the best opportunities are limited.

You’ll end up receiving leftovers.

Not being capabable of approaching opportunities is a giant disability.

Asking for what you want will mean that your options are limited.

Do you want low paying jobs with no room for growth or promotion. 

So I trained myself to be an extrovert.

I actively looked for opportunities.

I slowly taught myself how to get better at communicating my ideas.

I also spent time practicing how to communicate my needs.

English, like any language, is a complex skill with many parts.

Here are some parts to consider:

- **Reading and Comprehension**
- **Writing**
- **Editing and Formatting**
- **Speaking and Pronunciation**
- **Listening and Comprehension**
- **Words, Spelling and Vocabulary**
- **Grammar Rules and Sentence Construction**

There are a lot of things to consider.

When you see a long list of tasks, you lose enthusiasm.

Quitting is your natural reaction.

You may feel that you want to slowly back down.

It's normal.

People are terrified of work.

It's like seeing a dangerous animal.

That's one reason only few people are successful.

Everyone else works on their excuses.

People who want to improve their English, slowly back down.

They soon as they realize the number of lessons that they need to cover.

If they’re brave, they study on their own but get nowhere because they study the wrong things.

**English has 171,416 words.**

Where do you start?

If you try the brute force method and only have a time limit of one year for studying English, you need to learn 470 words a day.

If you give yourself two years, that’s 235 words a day.

Three years and it’s 120 words a day.

Do you have that much time?

You also need to use words repetitively.

Watching movies won’t help either because there is very little repetition involved.

Movies do not count as practice.

Movies are primarily a form of entertainment.

Learning words once and not using it again, means you’re going to forget it.

From grade school to high school English, our teachers taught us 5-10 new words every week.

Over a 10 year period (6 years grade school + 4 years high school) that’s about 2,500 to 5,000 words.

And because we only learned the new words and never used most of those words again. 

We forgot about most of those words that we learned in grade school.

One advantage of college is that you use the same words.

You focus on words that are important to your field of study.

You use these words over and over again.

You do this for four years or longer.

If you’re studying a medical course, you’re studying the medical terms.

If you’re studying engineering, you’re learning concepts but you’re also becoming more and more familiar with the practical terms. 

If you’re learning IT or Computer Science, you’re limited to tech words.

If you’re studying law, you’re limited to legal terms for contracts and legal related activities.

## So what’s the solution?

> I don’t fear the opponent who knows 10,000 techniques.
> I fear the man who practiced one technique 10,000 times.
> - Bruce Lee (paraphrased)

**In order to be fluent in a language, you need to be competent with the use of the 3,000 most commonly used words.**

Three thousand words is a lot less than one hundred and seventy one thousand four hundred and sixteen.

Here’s more good news.

**Out of three thousand words, one hundred words is used more than fifty percent of the time.**

What does that mean?

If you can learn to use and speak two words a day for the next six weeks, you already boosted your English skills by an extra 50%.

So if your current English skill is at 30%, then at the end of our lessons, you should be closer to 70% or 80% fluent if you follow our activities.

I had bad English grades despite watching a lot of English shows, playing lots of English games and reading English books and comic books.

I taught myself to be good in English.

**I trained myself to become an English Speaking Extrovert by writing things down.**

Even after starting with bad English…

I have made my living, earning from jobs that required good English communication skills.

- Gun store sales executive.
- Insurance company promo/marketing staff.
- Property salesperson for one of the largest real estate companies in the Philippines.
- Financial planner for a large insurance company.
- English teacher to Koreans.
- Outbound call center agent.
- Office manager for a Call Center Training School.
- Operations manager for a small call center.
- Product consultant and trainer for a health and skin care company.
- Account manager for recruitment services
- Sales and marketing executive for InfoTech.
- L2 customer account executive: L10 agent - Subject Matter Expert.
- I became a writer for several foreign websites.
- I became a project manager for an IT company.
- I’m still growing.

The funny thing is that writing is an introverts preferred activity. 

I wrote things down because it’s the easiest thing for me to do.

When you write, you have the following advantages:

The most practical benefit is you can see your ideas.

You have all the time in the world to think of your answer.

If you don’t have an answer, you can pause and come back to the question to give your answer. 

You can even ask other people for help.

You can edit your answers.

You can study your answers.

You can edit as many times as you need.

You can rewrite your answers.

You have a reference that you can practice when you speak.

You can always come back, repeat the process and craft better answers.

My favorite part about writing is you can collect ideas that will make your life better.

I’m a believer that the right idea, at the right time can change your life.

In many high paying jobs, you’re going to do a LOT of speaking.

If you’re a naturally good speaker, then you don’t need this training program.

If you’re not a naturally good speaker, then chances are you’re naturally better at writing.

Let’s start with that.

Let's start with writing. 

Let's transform your ability from a six to a seven.

Let's push you from a seven to an eight.

Let's practice to get you from an eight to a nine.

Eventually, let's aim to get you from nine to a ten.

Let's work on your writing ability.

Let's make your writing skills high level.

Writing positively influences your speaking ability.

I also have a shortcut.

It starts with writing.

It starts a few small changes.

Your speaking will be a lot better too.

This training program will help you prepare your interviews.

This program prepares you for daily conversations in the professional world.

Answer each question of every activity.

That said, you can practice writing your answers, stories, questions and instructions. 

Study and improve what you have written.

When your words are perfect you have a script to use.
