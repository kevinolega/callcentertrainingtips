## **How to Format Your Resume for a Call Center Job**

---

## Resume Length: 1 Page or 2 Pages?

Keep your resume short.

When was the last time you read a full catalog or manual?  
Exactly. Nobody does. Recruiters won’t either.

You’re not applying for a job that needs tons of credentials.  
You're applying for a call center job. Keep it simple.

---

### How long should your resume be?

- ✅ **Use 1 page** if you already have solid job experience.
- ✅ **Use 2 pages** if you're new and need to list seminars, freelance work, skills, or part-time jobs.
- 🔁 **Start with 2 pages**, then cut it down later when you have stronger experience.

When I was new to the job market, I used a two-page resume.  
It included all my short-term gigs, seminars, and extra skills.  

When I had more experience, I switched to a one-page resume.  
Later on, I went back to two pages after landing better jobs and collecting more wins.

Length depends on what you have to show. Just don’t add filler.  
Make every word earn its space.

### **Use Google Docs to Create Your Call Center Resume**

We don’t use Microsoft Word anymore.

**Google Docs is now the standard** for building and sending resumes—especially for call center job applications.

If you're used to Microsoft Word, don’t worry. **Google Docs works almost the same way**, with most of the same features.

But here’s why it’s better:

- **It’s free.** No need to buy software.
- **It auto-saves to your Google account.** You won’t lose your progress.
- **You can access it from any device.**
- **You don’t need to email your resume to yourself.**
- **You can easily export your resume as a PDF** for emailing or printing.

### Send Your Call Center Resume as a PDF

Always send your resume as a **PDF**, not a Word Document.

Why? Because PDF files keep your formatting exactly the way you set it.  

Word files can look different on other computers, especially when opened with different versions of Microsoft Word or other software.

This can be a big problem if you get your resume printed at a computer shop.  

The layout might shift, fonts might change, and your resume could end up looking messy or unprofessional.

PDFs solve that problem. They open the same way on every device.

**How to save your resume as a PDF in Google Docs:**

1. Click `File`  
2. Click `Download`  
3. Select `PDF Document (.pdf)`

That’s it. Simple and professional.

### Call Center Resume Filename

Fix your resume’s filename before sending it.

**Avoid generic names like:**

- `Document 01.docx`  
- `RESUME.doc`

Why? Because **90% of applicants use those names**.  
When a recruiter downloads your file, it gets lost in a folder full of other generic resumes.  
If they can’t find your file easily, you lose your chance.

**Use a clear and specific filename. Include:**

- Your full name  
- The position you're applying for  
- The date or version

**Examples:**

- `Kevin Olega Customer Service Resume 2020-01.pdf`  
- `Kevin Olega Virtual Assistant Resume 2016-06.pdf`  
- `Kevin Olega Freelance Writer Resume 2016-02.pdf`

**Pro Tip:**  
Keep copies of your old resumes. You can review them for experience, achievements, and **stories** to share during your interview.

---

### Call Center Resume Email Subject Line

Use a proper subject line when sending your resume by email.  

**Match your email subject line to your resume filename.**  
This makes your message clear and easy to find in the recruiter's inbox.

**Examples:**

- `Kevin Olega's Customer Service Representative Resume`  
- `Kevin Olega's Corporate Sales Representative Resume`  
- `Kevin Olega's Virtual Assistant Resume`

**Avoid common mistakes like:**

- Leaving the subject line blank  
- Just writing “Resume”

Those make you look careless, sloppy, or like you don’t pay attention to details.  
That’s not the impression you want to give when applying for a job.

**Remember:**  
Getting a high-paying job is the result of a thousand small steps done right.  
This is one of them.

---

## **How to Email Your Call Center Resume**

Here’s an optimized version that keeps the structure and tone while boosting clarity and flow:

---

### EMAIL YOUR RESUME

Start by making a list of the top call center companies you want to apply to.

Visit each company’s official website.

Look for their **Careers**, **Jobs**, or **Contact** page.

Search for the **recruitment email address** — this is usually listed on their hiring page or contact section.

Once you find it, **send your resume directly to their recruitment email.**

Keep your message short, polite, and professional.

This is a simple but effective way to get noticed — especially if you’re applying outside of job platforms.

---

### Sample Cold Email Template

Hi,

My name is Kevin.

I’d like to apply for a **Customer Service** position at your company.

I’m excited to contribute my skills and learn more about the role.

Please see my attached resume for your reference.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Kevin

---


### **Sample Referral Email Template**
Here’s the optimized version, keeping it friendly, professional, and beginner-proof:

Hi,

My name is Kevin.

Jason Cruz mentioned that you have an opening for a **Customer Service** position.

I’d like to offer my services for the role.

Please see my attached resume for your review.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,  
Kevin

---

### **Use a Professional Email Address in Your Call Center Job Application**

Don't use email addresses like `sexyangelbutterfly@yahoo.com` or `ilovechocolate@hotmail.com`.  
They might sound fun, but they don’t look professional—and that matters to recruiters.

Use an email address that includes your real name.

Examples:

- `kevinolega@gmail.com`  
- `hello@kevinolega.com` *(if you own a domain)*  
- `kevin@callcentertrainingtips.com`
- `kevin@olega.org` *(if you own a domain)*  

Other naming ideas:

- Add services or industry:  
  - `kevinolegaservices@gmail.com`  
  - `kevinolegamarketing@gmail.com`

- Use initials:  
  - `kolega@gmail.com`  
  - `kevino@gmail.com`

**Stop using Yahoo or Hotmail.**  
They're outdated and may cause issues with deliverability or spam filters.

✅ Use Gmail  
✅ Use iCloud (if you're on Apple)

These little changes help make a strong first impression—before they even open your resume.


### PLACE ACTIVE CONTACT NUMBERS ON YOUR CALL CENTER RESUME

Place active contact numbers at the top of your call center resume.

The recruiter will contact you when you qualify for a position.

The recruiter will call and/or email you to:

1. Conduct a phone interview.
2. Schedule an in-person interview.

When I was working in recruitment, if I couldn't reach an applicant on his or her mobile phone or landline, I move on to the next applicant.

Increase your message and call alert volume to the maximum whenever you are looking for work.

Never place your phone in silent mode.

Missed calls often lead to missed opportunities.

Answer calls politely and professionally.

---

## WHAT DO RECRUITERS SEE WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOUR CALL CENTER RESUME?

Recruiters scan resumes fast. Often in just a few seconds.

They look for signs you’re ready for the job—or reasons to skip you.

Here’s what they check first:

- Do you have a professional email address?
- Are there grammar, spelling, or formatting mistakes?
- Is your resume clean, readable, and well-written?
- Do you follow instructions?
- Are you easy to contact?

Small mistakes signal bigger problems:  
Lack of attention to detail, poor communication, or not taking the job seriously.

When I job hunt, I finalize my resume and print **30 clean copies**.  
That way, I don’t make excuses. I show up and apply. No whining until all 30 are used.

**Pro Tip:**  
Fix the basics.  
Make sure your resume isn’t eliminated for simple reasons that are 100% in your control.

---

## **Important Details to Include in a Call Center Resume**

Try to stick to **one page**.  
You don’t need to include everything—only what’s **relevant**.  
Optional details are just **fillers**. Add them only if you’re running short on space.

### ✅ Must-Have

1. Full Name  
2. Mobile Number (active and reachable)  
3. Email Address – **Use a professional email address**  
4. Home Address (City/Barangay is enough)  
5. Work Experience – Include part-time, freelance, or volunteer work  
6. Education – College is enough; add high school only if you need to fill space  
7. Training and Seminars  
8. Software Skills – Google Docs, Microsoft Office, WordPress, Photoshop, etc.

### 🟡 Optional (Use only if you need fillers)

- Landline number  
- Extra-curricular activities  
- Skills and interests  
- References  

---

## **Remove the Objective**

I didn’t include an objective because it’s obvious—you’re applying for a job.  
I also skipped the summary. I didn’t have much to say at the time, and I didn’t need to summarize that this was for a call center. The resume already makes that clear.

---

## **What to Do If Your Resume Looks Short**

I like to keep things **one page long**—but not less than **¾ of the page**.  
If your resume looks empty, it can seem like you rushed it or didn’t prepare well.

Here are **safe fillers** I add to bulk it up without looking desperate:

- Software knowledge (MS Office, Google Docs, CRM tools, etc.)  
- Training and seminars  
- References (only if you're short on content)  
- Extra-curricular activities or side gigs  
- Relevant skills and interests (related to customer service, tech, sales)

---

### **Keep It Relevant to Customer Service, Sales, or Tech Support**

---

## Add Relevant Information to Your Resume – Even Without Work Experience

If you’re applying for a phone-based job like **customer service**, **technical support**, or **sales**, and you don’t have exact work experience, that’s okay.

Stop saying, “I have no experience.”

You **do** have experience—you just haven’t learned how to talk about it *yet*.

You can pull examples from:

- Previous jobs (full-time, part-time, or freelance)  
- Informal cash gigs  
- Side hustles or online selling  
- School activities or projects  
- Volunteer work  
- Hobbies and real-life situations  
- Helping friends, family, or neighbors

This applies not just to call center roles, but also **teaching**, **writing**, **virtual assistant**, and **management** jobs.

I’ve gotten hired for those roles by drawing from my personal experience—even when it didn’t look like a match on paper.

---

### Real-Life Customer Service Experience
- I worked in a store. I talked to customers, helped with purchases, and kept things organized.  
- I logged sales, managed basic records, and made sure the store looked presentable.  
- I handled complaints and resolved customer issues calmly.  
- In a promo job, I helped explain product details and de-escalated angry customers.  
- I made sure people didn’t walk away upset—and most of the time, I fixed the problem before it reached the manager.  
- I learned how to be polite, clear, and calm under pressure.

---

### Real-Life Technical Support Experience
- I’m the go-to tech person in my family and circle of friends.  
- I’ve helped people with:  
  - Setting up computers and Wi-Fi  
  - Fixing phones and laptops  
  - Installing software and removing viruses  
  - Email recovery and password resets  
  - Syncing iPhones and backing up files  
- I’ve done tech support over the phone, chat, email, and in person.  
- I learned to explain tech in simple words—and developed **patience** and **communication skills**.  
- I’ve written step-by-step guides for people I helped.  
- One time, after a job interview, I helped the business owner sync his MacBook and iPhone. I was third on their list—but they hired me because of my tech skills and communication.

---

### Real-Life Sales Experience
- I sold clothes, gadgets, and household items on Facebook Marketplace, Carousell, Craigslist, and eBay.  
- I took photos, wrote descriptions, and answered customer questions.  
- I arranged meetups and deliveries, and dealt with cancellations, no-shows, and haggling.  
- I improved my listings by studying top sellers.  
- I helped my aunt with direct sales. I set appointments, gave product demos, closed deals, and processed orders.  
- I got used to **rejection** and **negotiation**—and built confidence talking to strangers.

---

### Real-Life Teaching and Coaching Experience
- I help beginners in martial arts warmups and techniques.  
- I break down drills, adjust based on their movement, and answer questions.  
- In school, I explained lessons to classmates and lower batch students.  
- I did part-time tutoring for cash. I got paid after each session.  
- I coached new sales reps informally by sharing tips and techniques.  
- I helped one coworker go from 3 appointments a month to 7 in one day.  
- I turned my interview and communication coaching into a book, a YouTube channel (6,000+ subs), and a TikTok account (90,000+ followers).  
- Some of our videos have over a million views.

---

### Real-Life Management Experience
- I was production manager for a school event—handling time, logistics, and last-minute issues.  
- I was assistant director for a play—managing props, people, and schedules.  
- I’ve led group projects in school and church—breaking down tasks, assigning roles, and following up.  
- I handled logistics for church and family events—from setup to cleanup.  
- I created checklists, tracked progress, sent updates, and made sure everything ran on time and under budget.  
- I learned to lead under pressure, keep things organized, and stay calm in chaos.

---

### **Your Resume Has to Be Interesting**

Recruiters receive hundreds—sometimes thousands—of resumes per job opening.  
They’re not reading every word.  
They’re skimming fast, looking for red flags or signs that you’re a strong match.

If your resume looks boring or generic, they’ll skip it and move on.

It’s not enough to “just list your experience.”  
You need to **stand out**, **sound capable**, and **grab attention within seconds**.

Your job is to **make it easy** for the recruiter to say:  
> “This person looks like someone we should talk to.”

That’s why your resume should be:
- Short  
- Relevant  
- Easy to read  
- Packed with helpful, real-world info  

I’ll walk you through how to do that in the next sections.

---

### **Write Specific Job Descriptions**

Don’t just list your job title.  
Recruiters want to **understand what you actually did**.

If you only write "Sales Representative" or "Customer Service Agent," that doesn't say much.  
Different companies assign different responsibilities, use different tools, and follow different procedures—even if the job titles sound the same.

Be specific. Show your skills, tools, wins, and responsibilities.

---

### **Add Numbers, Wins, and Proof**

Recruiters love numbers. They love proof. They love results.  
Here are some real examples from my own resume:

- Sold ₱11 million worth of property in 6 months as a real estate agent  
- Helped a call center school sell ₱5 million in training programs  
- Top agent for **Customer Satisfaction** in 2013  
- Top agent for **Tech Support Sales KPI** in 2015  
- Earned an extra ₱100,000 in incentives over two years  
- Consistent awardee for customer satisfaction  
- “Level 10” customer service rep (that’s just me having fun—but it helps the resume stand out)

---

### **Explain What You Actually Did**

Let’s say you worked in sales.  
What kind of sales job was it?

Some companies have salespeople:

1. Go to the office  
2. Talk to walk-in clients  
3. Answer phone inquiries  

Other companies want salespeople to:

- Research potential clients  
- Cold call or email leads  
- Build and maintain a customer database  
- Write marketing content or email campaigns  
- Set appointments and follow up  
- Scope client needs and write proposals  
- Present product demos  
- Negotiate pricing  
- Close deals and process paperwork  
- Follow up for payments  
- Maintain client relationships  
- Attend networking events  
- Manage social media accounts  
- And yes—answer the phone too  

See the difference?

Which one are you?

If you just write “Sales Rep,” I wouldn’t know.

Same thing for **Customer Service**, **VA**, **Tech Support**, **Admin**, or **Freelancer**.  
Your job title doesn’t tell the full story. **Your responsibilities do.**

---

### **Use Phrases Like These:**

To describe your work, start your sentences with:

- **Responsible for...** (outcomes and deliverables)  
- **In charge of...** (daily tasks and tools used)  

Ask yourself:

- What results or wins can I prove?  
- What tools did I use?  
- What kind of problems did I solve?  
- What tasks did I handle on my own?

The more specific and action-based your resume is, the more professional and trustworthy you’ll look.

Here’s a version you can insert right after the section on using phrases like "Responsible for..." and "In charge of...":

---

### **Bonus Tip: Write 20–30 Sentences About Your Past Jobs**

This is not just for your resume. It’s also **interview preparation**.

Sit down and write **20 to 30 sentences** describing what you did in your past jobs.  
Go beyond the surface. Include:

- Daily tasks  
- Problems you solved  
- Tools you used  
- Wins and accomplishments  
- How you helped the company or your teammates

If you want, **go crazy and write 100**.  
Then pick and organize your **top 20 to 30** sentences to help you remember the most useful stories and details.

Writing this in English will help you **recall important info** during job interviews and make your answers sound more natural and confident.

This is one of the fastest ways to improve your communication during interviews—**because you’re practicing with your own real-life experience**.

---

---

---

## **How Long Should a Resume Be?**

### One-Page or Two-Page Resume?

A **one-page resume** is ideal for most call center jobs—especially if:

- You have a few years of relevant experience  
- You don’t have gaps in your work history  
- You’re targeting entry-level to mid-level positions  

A one-page resume is easier to read, print, and share.  
It’s cheaper, too—especially if you’re printing 30 copies for walk-in applications.

---

### When to Use a Two-Page Resume

Go with a **two-page resume** if:

- You’ve had many short-term or freelance jobs  
- You’re highlighting a wide variety of skills  
- You need to include seminars, trainings, and filler info to support your application  
- You’re applying for more advanced roles or trying to explain a non-traditional work history

When I was just starting out, I used a two-page resume to include:

- All my part-time jobs  
- Volunteer experience  
- Trainings and seminars  
- Extra skills and interests

Later on, when I had more focused work experience, I switched to a one-page resume.

Eventually, as I gained even more experience and needed to highlight different types of roles, I went back to two pages.

---

**The rule:**  
Use **one page** if you can fit your most relevant experience clearly.  
Use **two pages** if you need more space to tell your story.  

Just make sure every section adds value. Don’t stretch your resume just to make it longer.

Want to keep it super practical?

- Print **30 copies of your one-page resume**  
- Print **10 copies of your two-page resume** for final interviews or jobs that need more details


### **One Page for Focused Experience**
Best for those with 1–2 solid jobs.

### **Two Pages for Broader Experience**
Great if you’ve done part-time, freelance, or changed jobs often.

---

### **Make Your Call Center Resume Easy to Read**

Recruiters don’t read every word—they **skim fast**.

Help them find what they need by making your resume **clean, readable, and professional**.

- Avoid fancy fonts, colors, or designs.
- Don’t use Comic Sans, cursive, or graffiti-style fonts.
- Stick to simple, professional fonts:
  - **Windows**: Arial, Verdana, Calibri  
  - **Google Docs**: Arial, Lato, Helvetica Neue, Open Sans  
  - **Mac**: Helvetica, Lato
- Use one font consistently. Two at most (for headings).
- **Recommended sizes:**
  - **Name:** 24 pt  
  - **Section Titles:** 16 pt  
  - **Body Text:** 11–14 pt

**Pro Tip:**  
Bold your section headers, but avoid too many colors or design elements.  
Your goal is clarity—not decoration.

Make sure your resume is easy to read **at a glance**, whether viewed on a screen or printed from a computer shop.

---

**Keep it minimal.**  
A clean layout helps recruiters find what they’re looking for. Too many fonts, colors, or designs make your resume harder to read—and harder to take seriously.

---

### **Avoid Resume Wizards and Overdesigned Templates**

Resume builders, wizards, and Canva templates might look flashy—but they often hurt more than they help.

- Many are cluttered with columns, lines, boxes, and graphics that don’t translate well when printed or viewed on different devices.  
- Some templates have too many sections that don’t fit your content.  
- Others use weird formatting that makes editing difficult.

I’ve tried Apple Pages templates. I’ve tested Google Docs templates. Some looked okay—but most had too much going on.

---

**Here’s what I do instead:**  
I write my resume in a plain Google Doc using a clean, top-to-bottom layout.  
No columns.  
No lines.  
No graphics.  
Just the information that matters, presented clearly.

---

**Avoid Canva-style resumes with colors, emojis, icons, and decorations.**  
They might look “creative” to you—but:

- They’re harder to read.  
- They’re expensive to print.  
- They make you look like a student doing an art project.  

### **Check for Typos and Errors**

Nothing ruins a good resume like a typo—especially if it’s in your phone number or email.  
Copy-paste your resume into a grammar tool like **Grammarly**.  

Read it out loud.  
Go over it at least **20 times**.

---

### **Ask Someone to Proofread Your Resume**

Even after checking it yourself, get a second pair of eyes.  
Ask a friend or family member with good English to help.

Typos are easy to miss—and easy to fix.  
Don’t lose a job opportunity over something so small.

---

## Final Resume Submission Checklist

Before you print and submit your resume, go through this quick checklist:

- Fix all grammar and spelling errors.
- Keep formatting simple and clean.
- Use good-quality paper if submitting in person.
- Keep your resume neat—no folds, no smudges.
- Print at least 30 copies.
- Only include short, relevant, and useful information.

You don’t need a flashy layout. You don’t need a fancy font.  
You just need a clean, clear resume that tells the recruiter you can do the job.

---

## **Walk-In Resume Application Tips**

Walk-in applications are part of the call center job hunt.

At some point, you’ll find yourself in a call center office.  
You’ll tell the receptionist you’re applying—or say you have an appointment if a recruiter invited you.

Then you’ll hand over your resume and use it as a guide during your interview.

Here’s how to make the most of your walk-in applications:  
- Show up prepared  
- Bring multiple copies  
- Stay confident  
- Treat each one as **practice or opportunity**—ideally, both.

---

### **Print Your Resume Using Good Paper and Ink**

Project a **professional image**—even before you speak.

Don’t ruin it by using cheap, low-quality paper.

- It’s okay to print at a computer shop that charges ₱3–₱5 per page.  
- Just make sure the **print quality and paper** look clean and professional.  
- If the print looks faded or smudged, bring your own paper.  
- If that still doesn’t help, **find a better shop**.

Your resume is your **first impression**—make it look like you care.

---

### **Print Multiple Copies of Your Resume**

Always bring extra copies.

I’ve had **dozens of interviews** because someone random—an aunt, uncle, or friend—asked for my resume on the spot.  
They were about to meet someone hiring, and I was ready.

But I’ve also **missed out** on great jobs because I didn’t have a copy with me.  
Someone else got hired the same day.

Spare copies give you options:

- If this interview doesn’t work out, you can walk into another company.  
- Nearby call centers become your **Plan B**.  
- Even if this job isn’t “the one,” the interview becomes **practice** for your next offer.

---

### **Print 30 Copies of Your Resume**

Some companies will say yes. Others will say no. That’s normal.

Take the rejections as **practice** and use what you learn to prepare for better opportunities.

Getting hired is a **numbers game**. The more you apply, the better your chances.

Think of job interviews like **first dates**—you don’t marry the first one.  
You meet several, see who’s a match, and then make your choice.

Bring 30 clean copies of your resume so you can keep applying without excuses.

**Pro Tip:**  
You don’t get to complain until you’ve submitted **all 30 resumes.**

---

### **Cost of Printing Call Center Resumes**

Only print your resumes when you’re 100% happy with the content—**no typos, no grammar errors**.

Printing usually costs **₱5 per page**.  
So if you print **30 one-page resumes**, that’s **₱150**.  
If you’re using a **two-page resume**, it’ll cost **₱300**.

When I was low on budget, I created two versions:

- **One-page resume** for most applications  
- **Two-page resume** for final interviews

Here’s how I handled it:

- 30 single-page resumes = ₱5 × 30 = **₱150**  
- 10 two-page resumes = ₱10 × 10 = **₱100**  
- **Total: ₱250**

If you’re short on cash, that extra ₱50 makes a difference.  
So make sure your resumes stay clean and protected—**use a hard envelope.**

### **Store Your Resume in a Hard Folder or Envelope**

Don’t hand in a crumpled resume. It looks sloppy—and it sends the wrong message.

> How you do anything reflects how you do everything.

Even if you print a great resume, commuting or carrying it around can damage it.  
A **hard folder or envelope** protects your resume from folds, spills, and other accidents.

Bring multiple copies, but **don’t carry them loose in your hand or stuffed into your bag.**  
Show up with a **clean, crisp copy** that tells the interviewer you’re serious and prepared.

### **Use Leftover Resumes for Walk-Ins or Referrals**

### **Bring More Than Three Resumes**
**Using Your Call Center Resume for Walk-In Applications**

Let me tell you about Ice.

I met her at a drinking session. We were both looking for a job. I told her I wanted to work in a call center and earn ₱20,000 a month. She said she was job hunting too, so we decided to apply together. She brought along a friend.

I only knew three companies.  
She knew more.

We failed at Convergys.  
We failed at ICT.  
We failed at Teleperformance.  
PeopleSupport required college graduates at the time.

👉 [We failed at Convergys together](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/convergys-fail/)

But Ice had a trick.

At every building, she’d talk to the security guard and ask:  
> “Are there any other call center companies here?”  
> “What are their names?”  
> “What floors are they on?”  
> “Where do job applicants go?”

Then she’d say:  
> “Sir, I really need a job. My parents are going to kick me out if I don’t find one. Please help me.”

She wasn’t shy. She asked for help, and guards responded. That day, we walked into a single building and found **seven** call centers.

I had only brought **three resumes**.  
Ice had around **twenty**.

I ran out after the third company.  
She kept submitting.  
I looked awkward asking the receptionists at companies 4 to 7 if I could submit a resume later.

At company six, the HR head processed Ice’s application on the spot.  
At company seven, the business owner was just chilling in the office.  
He interviewed her right there and hired her.  
She was scheduled to start the following week.

I told myself I’d come back to those other companies with more resumes.

I never did.

### **Lesson: Always Bring Extra Copies of Your Resume**
- Don’t just bring three.  
- Bring **15 to 30 copies** if you're serious.  
- You might discover more opportunities in one building.  
- Don’t be the person saying, “I’ll come back.” Most people don’t.

Let this story be your reminder. Be like Ice. Bring more resumes. Talk to people. Ask questions. And don’t limit yourself to just one company.

## **Applying Online? Here’s What to Do**

### **Send to 20–200 Companies**

Here’s the optimized version you can paste directly into the new doc:

---

## **Use Your Resume for Online Applications**

Don’t just send your resume to 5 or 10 companies and wait.

That’s not enough.

If you’re not getting interviews, here’s what to check:

- Is your resume well-written and easy to read?  
- Any grammar, spelling, or formatting mistakes?  
- Is your contact information correct and up to date?  
- Are you clearly showing your strengths and qualifications?  
- Are you sending your resume to enough companies?

**Ten is too few.**  
When I’m applying for call center jobs, I send my resume to **20 to 200 companies**.

Apply as much as you can.  
Get the interview first.  
Then choose the best offer after you’ve had a real conversation with the recruiter.

**Pro Tip:**  
Don’t wait for the perfect job to show up.  
Send your resume now—refine your options later.

---

### **Prepare to Answer Every Call**

After submitting your resume, keep your phone nearby.  
**Expect unknown numbers**—they could be recruiters.

Answer **every call like it’s an interview.**  
Speak clearly, politely, and in English.

If you miss a call:

1. Call back **twice**  
2. Send a polite SMS follow-up

**Sample callback spiel:**

> I'm sorry I missed your call. May I know who's this?

**Never say:**  
- “Who’s this?”  
- Or worse—“Sino 'to?” in Filipino.

**Here’s what I say instead:**

> Hello, good morning (or afternoon/evening). May I know who's this?  

Stay professional—**this could be your job call.**

---

## **Fix Your References and Online Profile**

### **Notify Your References**
Let your references know you’re applying for jobs so they can answer calls from recruiters.  
A quick heads-up helps them prepare to speak positively and professionally about you.

---

### **Update Your Facebook Page**
Most recruiters won’t run a full background check—but they **will** check your Facebook.  
In just 3–5 minutes, they’ll form an impression. Make sure it’s a good one.

#### **What to Fix on Facebook:**

- **Use your real name.** Nicknames are okay for your first name, but your last name should be real. Fake names = red flag.
- **Add a clear profile photo of your face.** Avoid anime, group pics, or shirtless selfies. No face = no confidence.
- **Be honest about school and work.** Don’t joke around with “Hogwarts” or “Works at Krusty Krab.” That’s a red flag for integrity.
- **Clean up questionable posts.** Remove rants, fake news, drama, extreme political or religious posts—anything you wouldn’t say in a job interview.

> Recruiters want to know: Can we trust you to represent our company?
>  
> Your Facebook is part of your resume now. Make it professional.

## **Write Resume-Based Interview Stories**

### **Why It Matters**
Interviewers ask for stories not listed on the resume.

### **How to Create Your Stories**
Pick experiences from work, school, or volunteer work.

### **Practice Long and Short Versions**
Write 5–20 sentence and 100-sentence versions for flexibility.

---

## **Common Call Center Resume Questions**

### **Should I Add a Picture?**
Pros and cons, local context vs. Western style.

### **Should I Include My Objective?**
Only if it adds value.

### **Should I Sign My Resume?**
No need.

### **Should I Add Personal Info?**

---

## Keep Your Resume Simple

Your resume doesn’t need to be fancy.

It just needs to show:
- Your name and contact info  
- Work history  
- Education  
- Relevant skills  

Make sure it tells the recruiter what you were responsible for in each job.  
Highlight skills and experience that apply to call center work.

Don’t include personal info like:
- Height  
- Weight  
- Religion  
- Civil status  

You're not applying as a promo model.  
You're applying to help customers, handle calls, and follow processes.  
Leave out the fluff.

---

### **Remove Personal Info from Your Resume**

Personal info is not required in a call center resume.

Remove these:

- Height  
- Weight  
- Age or Date of Birth  
- Religion  

Call centers don’t care about your vital stats. They care about **what you can do for them**.

Don’t waste space, ink, or attention on irrelevant details.

You don’t need to include **everything**. Keep your resume relevant.

If you've had many jobs, **just list the last 3–4**—unless you job-hopped a lot and need to explain your work history.

---

### **Unnecessary Resume Fillers (and Why to Remove Them)**

**AGE / DATE OF BIRTH**  
Only matters if you're **under 18** or **over 60**—which can disqualify you automatically.  
No need to help recruiters judge you based on your zodiac sign. (Yes, I worked for someone who did that.)

**HEIGHT / WEIGHT**  
This isn’t a modeling or security guard job.  
Unless you're heavy enough to break chairs, your weight isn't relevant. You're safe.

**RACE / EYE COLOR / NATIONALITY**  
Call centers are equal opportunity employers. These don’t matter unless a working visa is required.

**RELIGION**  
No issue with any faith or no faith.  
The only concern is if it affects your **availability** for training or work schedules.

**SEX**  
Doesn’t matter. Male, female, in between—you’re welcome.

**SSS / TIN / PAG-IBIG / PHILHEALTH / PASSPORT**  
All of these are **confidential** and **irrelevant** during the hiring stage.  
You can give them **after** you're hired.

**DECLARATION STATEMENTS**  
> “I hereby declare that the information is true…”  
Not needed. That’s already implied.

**SIGNATURE**  
Your resume is **not a contract**. No signature required.

---

### **Should You Add a Photo to Your Resume?**

In the U.S., adding a photo is discouraged.  
But in the **Philippines**, recruiters and even **security guards** often **ask for one**.

I tried not including a photo before. It was a hassle.  
So I added a small ID-style photo to my resume file—**clean, clear, and presentable**.

It made things easier during walk-in interviews.

Your photo helps people identify you during screening. It also shows **confidence**.

- If you look good, great—it's a plus.  
- If you think you don't—add it anyway and show up with confidence.  

Here’s the **main reason I kept the photo** in my resume:

When I go to an office with **multiple applicants**, or attend a **mass hiring event or job fair**, it gets chaotic.  
The **guard, receptionist, or HR staff** often call out names into the crowd—sometimes mispronounced or shouted in the wrong direction.  
It’s awkward, inefficient, and easy to miss your turn.

With a photo, they can **immediately recognize you** without shouting your name several times.  
No more confusion. No more delays. Just **smooth identification** and faster processing.

## **Write Resume-Based Interview Stories**

> “Tell me something about yourself that’s not in your resume.”

Most applicants misunderstand this question.  
They start talking about high school, hobbies, or personal struggles.

But what the interviewer really wants is the **story behind the resume**.

### Why You Need Stories

Companies hire people to **solve problems**.  
Interviewers want to know if you can do that—and if you’ve done it before.

Your stories should show:

- Problems you solved  
- Things you did well  
- Times you made an effort  
- Lessons you learned from failure  
- Times you worked hard to get a win  

These make your answers **interesting**, **memorable**, and **credible**.

### Questions Interviewers Often Ask:

- Tell me about your previous job.  
- Why did you leave?  
- What did you like or dislike about it?  
- What did you like or dislike about your boss?  
- What are you looking for in your next job?  
- What kind of situation would you like to avoid?

If your answers are careless or shallow, you’ll hurt your chances.  
Saying “I’m just looking for greener pastures” or “my boss was toxic” might come back to bite you.

### The Follow-Up Trap

Interviewers will challenge vague or copied answers.

> “What if we offer less money?”  
> “What if your next boss is worse?”  
> “What if the job is harder than expected?”

If your answers aren’t grounded in real stories, you’ll stumble.  
That’s why you need to **prepare now**.

### How to Write Interview Stories from Your Resume

1. **Go through each section** of your resume.
2. For each school or job, ask yourself:
   - What’s one great thing I experienced here?
   - What’s something I didn’t like?
   - What did I learn?
   - How did it help me grow?

3. Do the same for:
   - Your home address
   - Schools you attended
   - References listed
   - Volunteer work
   - Hobbies and side gigs

4. Think of these as prompts:
   - What’s the story of where you live?
   - What’s the story of how you learned a key skill?
   - What’s one tough situation you overcame?

---

### Why This Matters

You’re not just answering interview questions.  
You’re **giving proof** that you’re a reliable, skilled, and thoughtful person.

Most people copy answers from Google.  
Recruiters have heard them all.

You don’t want to sound like a fake.

When I copied answers before, I got hit with follow-up questions.  
I froze. I sounded like a liar. I didn’t get the job.

Now I write my own stories—and everything changed.

---

### Your Story is Better Than Mine

You might think, “But I don’t have any good stories.”

You do.

And they’re better than mine—because they’re **real**.

You can’t copy my stories.  
But you can write your own, and that will make all the difference.

If you’re stuck, write out the long version (100 sentences).  
Then cross out the 50-80 sentences that aren't that important.
Select the top 20 most relevant sentences.
Practice a shorter version (5–20 sentences).

Record yourself.  
Read it out loud.  
Check for grammar, flow, and energy.

Ask:
- Does this story make me look like a great hire?
- Does it show I can solve problems?
- Does it reflect who I am?

---

### Practice = Confidence

You don’t need to memorize your stories.  
You just need to **practice telling them in English** so you’re ready when it counts.

Stories are the closest thing to proof.

That’s why we use them.

If you want help crafting your stories, I run a training program that focuses on **turning your life experiences into job-winning stories**.
