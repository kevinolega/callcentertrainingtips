## Parts of a call center interview

The first part of a call center is the introduction.

You want to get to know each other. 

You'll be asked to "tell them about yourself."

The second part is where you discuss your past jobs and work experience.

The interviewer matches what you can do to what is required in a job.

You'll be asked to "talk about your past jobs" or "talk about your career from the time you left school."

The third part is the job fit.

The interviewer assess if you are a fit for the job based on your past behavior and your attitude.

You'll be given different situations that are similar to what they need. 

## Objective of a call center interview

The objective of the call center interview is to answer two questions:

1. Are you a good person to hire?
2. Are you a good person?

Many don't realize that these two questions summarize all the call center questions. 

Here are more specific versions of the above two questions.

However, please remember that interviewers rarely ask these questions directly.

Are you a good person to hire?

- Can you work as a call center agent?
- Can you speak English well?
- Can you type fast enough?
- Can you navigate computers easily?
- Are you patient enough for customer service?
- Are you persistent enough for sales?
- Are you thorough enough for technical support?
- Are you disciplined enough to work in a night-shift schedule?
- Are you responsible enough for a higher paying job?
- Are you organized enough to qualify for a management post?

Are you a good person?

- Will you stay at the company for two years or longer?
- Will you follow company rules and procedures?
- Will you be respectful to all coworkers and customers?
- Will you make a sincere effort to learn and master the job?
- Will you be truthful in your interactions?
- Will you stay disciplined and go to work even when you don't feel like it?
- Will you stay professional and keep personal problems out of the office?
- Will you be at work on time all the time and never miss a scheduled shift?

These are questions that interviewers rarely ask directly but it's important to remember that there are other ways of asking these questions.


## Types of Interview Questions

There are two types of interview questions.

- Direct questions

- Indirect questions

Direct questions often have only one answer.

- What's your name?
- Where do you live?

Indirect questions are often open ended where you are asked to narrate a story.

- Talk about your past job.

- Tell me about a situation when...


## Your goals in a call center interview


Your goal is to convince the interviewer that you are good enough based on the secret questions that I have shared.

However, just as the interviewer can't ask obvious questions directly, it won't be good for you to answer the same questions directly.

A person who says he's trustworthy can't be trusted.

A person who say's he's honest is probably lying.

A person who says he's loyal is probably cheating on you.

How do I tell the interviewer that I'm a good person without directly telling them that I'm a good person?

I'll make a good call center agent!

I'm very hard working!

I'm professional and honest!

I'm good at speaking English!

These are answers that many beginners make.

Read these sentences again?

How do the sentences sound?

Even if you read the sentences confidently, it's going to sound awkward.

How do I tell the interviewer that I'm a good person without directly telling them that I'm a good person?

It took me several years to figure this out.

I studied the best practices at different industries including sales, marketing, negotiation, and psychology to put this together.

Here's the heirarchy.

The lowest level of answer is the direct answer.

The better answer is to give examples.

The best answer is to share stories.
