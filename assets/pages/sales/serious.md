My page attracts thousands of people who want to improve their lives.

I built my reputation around helping people build confidence to get hired in a call center.

I've helped some of my students achieve their goals by teaching them how to be more competent at selling, teaching, and developing their other skills.

My success comes with both upsides and downsides.

The upside is I get to help a lot of people.

The downside is my busy schedule, and I don't get to help everyone.

One problem that I have as my site attracted more people is that I now have more people to fit into my schedule.

I have experience of people who pay me for lessons.

I give these students simple writing exercises.

They drop out.

As a result, I have to implement policies that filter out the serious people from the people who waste time.

If you're serious about getting better, please pass this simple test.
