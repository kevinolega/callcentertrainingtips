## Tell me more about your program

We designed our program to help our students become comfortable speaking English during interviews and everyday conversations.

We use writing exercises to help you practice expressing your thoughts, discover your grammar problems, and reveal your deficiencies.

We conduct a phone coaching session to discuss corrections and give you advice on how to communicate more effectively.

The lessons help applicants prepare for BPO work, sales and supervisory roles.

The activities benefit almost any job.

You can confidently perform the following tasks after completing the exercises:

1. Introduce yourself.
2. Ask questions.
3. Give instructions.
4. Share stories.

We will always have an opportunity for Q&A during the phone coaching and email activities.

If you need me to help you with a weakness that's bothering you, let me know, and I will help you with that.

## Why Is This Affordable?

## Is This a Scam?

## Are You Legit?

Please don't trust us blindly. 

We only provide English lessons. 

We have students who succeed and we also have students who fail. 

We only provide lessons and guidance. 

We send writing exercises to our students and we check their answers.

We teach our students what to fix and we give advice on how to sound better. 

We give you access to a library, an exercise area, and an instructor.

That's it. 

There's nothing magical about our lessons.

If your expectation is when you enroll, you'll magically qualify for a high paying job, then you have the WRONG IDEA.

Success requires work.

## What is The Schedule of Phone Coaching?

## Do You Offer English Lessons Only? NON CALL CENTER?

That option is available. 

## Do You Offer Certificate?

Helping our student sharpen their communication skills is our main focus.

We do award a certificate of completion that says you participated in our six week English lessons.

However, we sincerely believe that upgrading your communication skills is more valuable than any certificate.

## Do You Give Certificate Upon Enrollment?

## What's the difference of the packages? Which one should I get?

It really depends on your skill level budget 

If low budget and low priority yung improvement get the ₱557.

If low budget and medium priority yung improvement get the ₱799.

If low budget and high priority yung improvement get the ₱1,099.

If maraming budget get the ₱2,357.

You get more sessions kasi if you get more weeks.

Pero if low priority lang talaga, get the lower plan kasi sayang if you get six weeks tapos mag-quit ka rin.
