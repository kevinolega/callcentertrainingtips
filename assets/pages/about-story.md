I started looking for work in 2004 but had trouble landing a job because of poor communication skills.

A close friend recommended that I begin working in sales.

I learned how to 


## My Call Center Training Credentials

I grew up with the reputation of having horrible communication skills.

I'm not an English major. 

I'm not a communications graduate. 

I only had one year of college.

Despite these disadvantages, my studies have allowed me to qualify for jobs that require a higher level of communication skills. 

I have four years of call center work experience.

I have two years experience assisting in the call center training school. 

I consider this a blessing because several call centers accept high school graduates and only a handful of strict ones require two years or a degree in college.

I'm a kinesthetic learner.

That means I learn about things through active research, personal experience, and the help of people better than me.

What I offer on this website are about my personal experience.

The lessons are a documentation of strategies and stories of how I helped myself.

Occassionally I share about how I assisted a few friends get hired in a call center and other high paying jobs.

I spent a lot of time studying strategies on improving confidence and communication skills.

I am not an expert in grammar, pronunciation or accents but I've improved mine to a point where nobody complains about it.

I spent the last fifteen years working in jobs that require high-level communication skills as a primary requirement. 

I teach how I communicate and the story behind my techniques.

My training focus on:

- Building confidence while speaking in English.
- Correcting common grammar and pronunciation mistakes.
- Basics of call center work.
- Preparing for call center interviews.
- Designing and building your dream life around call center income.

You can read all the lessons here for free.

This is my primary form of community service.

## How did this interest start?

In 2005, I worked for the pioneer call center training school in Quezon City.

I secretly went through the job application process of well-known call center companies to understand qualifications for call center work.

My research became the base material for how to find work in a call center.

Unfortunately, the owner of the company migrated and the school closed down in 2009.

Outside the call center school, I worked on improving my strategies for personal use.

I had bad communication skills and continued my research to fix my own problems.

Eventually, I taught my friends how to get call center work.

Iâ€™ve been giving away these lessons and tips for over fifteen years already.

### UPDATE 2013:

I eventually worked in a call center. I have been working in a call center for three years. In my first year, I almost failed regularization. My new boss told me that my previous boss recommended me for termination. He didn't stop there though. He helped me identify my strengths and overcome my weaknesses and eventually I got regularized. The next month, I was awarded top agent for customer feedback. The following year, I was awarded top agent again for the most number of repair calls converted into sales. Using the same method my boss taught me, I just got really better at what I did. If you're interested I can also teach you. Just send me a message.

### Update 2017:

I have left the call center after three years. I was a top agent twice and was classified super agent for the day.I now work from home taking care of foreign clients with their business. I used the call center money to buy the computers I need for a home-based work setup, I bought the tools to build a beautiful kitchen, I bought a few bikes to take care of my transportation and I enrolled at CrossFit to help manage my depression.

### Update 2019:

I'm still working remotely (from anywhere). Some days, I work from home, some days, I connect from a computer shop. Some days, I rent an office. I still work out and I'm working on improving my sleep and my health further. I eat a meat-only diet.

### Update 2020:

Last December, we launched a six week English learning program and attracted hundreds of students. I spend half my day sending lessons, helping my students improve their communication skills and giving career advice.

Shortly after Mitzi began to help me manage the students and in March, Carla began to help us with answering messages.

I rent a small venue that doubles as my office, studio and personal gym.

I have more free time to write.
