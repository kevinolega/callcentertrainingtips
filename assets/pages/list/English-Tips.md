## Five activities that improves your English

Call centers require good communication skills. 

English is the primary language and the best part is that your English does not have to be perfect for you to get hired because conversational level English will do.

If you’re looking for ways to learn how to improve your English, here are some of the tips I can offer to improve your communication skills faster.

## Think in English

We all talk to ourselves in our head. 

The question is what language are you using?

## Sossy Mode Gives You Powerful, Smooth, Confident English

> You won’t get to use the blessings that you have if you hate them. -Kevin Olega

We Filipinos have a pretty unique attitude when it comes to the English language. 

We pick on grammar errors and call them “barok” or “carabao English”. 

We pick on pronunciation errors and call them “Bisaya” or “probinsyano”. 

Here’s the best part, **a lot of Filipinos don't have better speaking ability than the people they bully for speaking in English** and when they do encounter a local who speaks very well we call them “pa-social” (which implies that they are social climbers and trying to pretend to be rich) or we call their English “slang” (which I guess should be natural at that level) or worse we call them “maarte” (which means spoiled, high class, picky or hard to please).

## Activate Celebrity Mode for Smooth Confident English

Sometimes, we don’t feel like ourselves when we speak in English. 

It’s as if we need to act out a new persona to do that. 

I actually see nothing wrong with it.

I was training a friend recently and he suddenly started making a lot of mistakes with his English.

## Smile to sound better when you talk

> A smile can often get you out of unfavorable situations.
-Sai (Naruto Shippuuden)

Smile when you talk. 

They say a smile can be heard on the phone.

Why the heck is this important?

## Common English Pronunciation Errors

Many Filipinos can understand English. 

A lot of us can speak it fluently. 

Many foreigners I’ve met say that Filipinos can speak fluently. 

Despite that many fail call center screenings due to minor errors.

Minor errors are forgivable.
