If you sent us the questions:

- Are you legit?
- Is this payment first? I've been scammed before.
- How do I know that you will teach me after I pay?
- Please send me your proof of transactions?
- Do you have other enrollees?

This is my answer.

Based on experience, 95% of people who ask these questions don't enroll anyway.

When I interview these people, half the time, these people have an attitude problem and just want to pay so they can blame us instead because of their lack of results in life.

ANSWER 1:

Please inspect our page before offering to send us money.

Do not blindly trust us.

I'm not going to tell you why you should pay us to teach you. 

We have been posting free lessons since 2012.

We just opened this service from people who want to practice with a real person who will coach them with their communication skills.

ANSWER 2:

The fact that you didn't inspect our page means there's something wrong with your verification skills.

You need to fix that.

If your goal is to get hired in a BPO, call center, as a virtual assistant or participate in any high paying high-stress environment, basic research is a required skill.

Please check the age of this page.

Please read all of our posts.

Please inspect our website https://callcentertrainingtips.com

Please do a Google search about us.

Then make your decision if you want to continue.

ANSWER 3

If you don't want to enroll, that's okay.

If the problem is our information is too long, you didn't read, then please don't enroll with us.

You are supposed to read to learn skills.

OBJECTION 

I don't have the time to research you. My internet is slow. I'm willing to trust you if you say you're legit.

Can you just tell me if you're legit or not?

ANSWER 

No. If you don't want to take the time to research who we are (2-10 minutes to check this page, our website, and YouTube channel), that's already a sign that you're a lazy student and horrible person to teach. Please don't enroll.
