## ADVICE ON FREELANCING

Don't go into freelancing blindly.

You'll need money to get started.

I recommend that you save up ₱200,000 to 300,000 before jumping in full time.

You'll need to buy a nice computer.

A good computer may cost anywhere from ₱50,000-100,000.

You'll need to pay for fast internet.

Fast internet in the Philippines roughly costs ₱2,000 a month.

You'll need backup internet for emergencies.

Some jobs require an iPhone or flagship smartphone.

You'll need to buy a second laptop in the event of an accident or emergency.

You'll need money for six months of client acquisition activities.

You'll need to have an emergency fund for deals that don't push through.

You'll need to order food if you're working on a deadline.

You'll need to speak great English.

You'll need to get used to speaking to Americans.

You'll need to be knowledgeable with common web technologies.

You'll need to buy some software for your field of specialization.

You'll need to up your writing skills to 9/10.

I choose to work for a call center to save money, practice my skills, buy my computer and eventually get started.
