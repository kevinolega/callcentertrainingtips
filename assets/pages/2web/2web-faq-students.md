Then we will wait for you to finish.[/expand]

## WHY HAVEN'T WE SCHEDULED PHONE COACHING?

The phone coaching session gets scheduled after you complete lesson 1 to lesson 7 of your current week.

That's because, we will discuss your answers to the writing exercises and help fix your grammar and pronunciation.

## I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH THE ACTIVITIES. WHAT DO I DO?

Focus on writing one sentence at a time.

## HOW DO I SEND THE ACTIVITIES?

Please use Google Docs

## THE ACTIVITIES ARE TOO LONG.

No.

15 sentences can be done in 15 minutes.

Aim to write 1 sentence per minute.

The intention is to help you become comfortable communicting in English.

## THE ACTIVITIES ARE TOO DIFFICULT. SHOULD I GIVE UP?


<details>
	<summary>What you're experiencing is normal. I encounter this issue often.</summary>
	<pre>
If the activities are too difficult, that's because this is your first time exercising your writing skills.

Anything you are doing for the first time, is uncomfortable.

It's exactly like going to the gym for the first time.

It is going to be uncomfortable and painful.

Sometimes you'll feel stupid.

And that's a good thing.

Discomfort is a sign that you are learning something new.

## THE QUESTIONS ARE TOO PERSONAL. CAN I SKIP THESE QUESTIONS?

Our goal is to help you develop your ability to express yourself in English comfortably and confidently.

We begin with opening up topics about yourself and slowly transition to more professional and work-related conversations.

## DO I NEED TO PRINT THE ACTIVITIES?

You may, but it's not required.

## DO I ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS?

Yes. Please do.

## DO I NEED TO ANSWER CALL CENTER QUESTIONS? I ONLY WANT TO IMPROVE MY ENGLISH.

Please remember that the written activities are communications practice, and is not limited to "Getting Hired as a Call Center Agent".

You have to be able to articulate your goals, plans, intentions, preferences, and ideas.

## DO I NEED TO WRITE THE QUESTIONS?

Yes. 

This is additional English practice.

This also makes the discussion easier.

## THE ACTIVITIES TAKE TOO MUCH TIME. HOW DO I FIT THIS TRAINING IN MY SCHEDULE?

Write for 30 minutes to an hour then stop if you're out of time.

You can continue the next day.

We understand that different people have different schedules and repsonsibilities. 

We don't expect you to finish everything in one day.

And that's okay.

## I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE TIME LIMIT. 

WILL FAILING TO COMPLETE THE EXERCISES KICK ME OUT OF YOUR TRAINING?

No.

We did specify two weeks for the lessons; however, we would prefer to NOT implement a finished or not finished policy.

If you need more time, we will give you more time.

We extended the training period to 60 days.

## WHAT'S THE MEANING OF WORD OR PHRASE?

For words and phrases that you need help with, a quick search on Google is incredibly useful.

Research is a small but incredibly useful call center skill.

## I DON'T WANT TO SUBMIT MY ANSWERS BECAUSE I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY ENGLISH.

That's okay.

Write poorly.

Answer those questions.

Fill those pages with your thoughts so we have something to fix.

We repair your broken English during the phone coaching.

## I GIVE UP

It's okay to give up.

I have less work to do if you give up.

I'm more worried about you though.

Have you ever met anyone who is both happy and successful that doesn't have good communication skills?

Me neither.

If you want to become happy and successful, work on your communications skills.

We're here to help you.
