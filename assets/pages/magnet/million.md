The next time someone tells you it's impossible to earn a million working in a call center, here's something you can tell them.

You don't know how to count.

Here's a computation of how much money you can earn while working in a call center.

In the computation, you start earning the usual minumum.

₱18,000 a month.

After two years, you may apply for a more tenured role.

₱25,000 a month.

On your fifth year, you may get another pay increase with a more senior role.

₱30,000 a month.

Note, all these computations only apply if you are disciplined and patient.

Here's the computation.
