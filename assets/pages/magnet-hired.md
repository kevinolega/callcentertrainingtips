Hi there!

Congratulations for getting hired.

I put together this page for you.

So you know what to do.

90% of your training batch won't get regularized or stay with the company after one year.

Out of almost thirty in our batch, only three of us were left working in the company after a year.

I'm not trying to scare you.

I'm telling you the truth.

I had a big crush on our OM so I always looked at her when she's in the office.

But because I was always looking at her... 

I also saw the giant whiteboard next to her office desk nobody bothered to clean from a recent client meeting.

The whiteboard had:
* The stats of our site.
* It has the number of agents.
* The overall AHT.
* The overall customer feedback score.
* The overall sales.
* The overall attendance.
* And all the other KPI.

The whiteboard also had...

90% of the agents hired quit or get fired within one year.

90% of agents who stay stay for two years.

Less than 10% of agents are tenured or experienced.

In other words, 90% of agents are newbies.

In other words, weaklings.

This informations scared me at first and encouraged me after giving further consideration.

I have an opportunity to keep winning because I am only competing with the top 10% of the agents.

And 90% of all the people I've met have given up on improving themselves after they recieved this magical piece of paper called a DIPLOMA.

I put this guide so you can teach yourself to stop being a weakling.

I want to change your destiny from the kind of LOSER who always asks for help...

To the kind of WINNER who is always giving help.

Jesus said:

> "If You Abide in My Word, You Are Truly My Disciples"

I am not Jesus.

I'm just an asshole with a website.

But if you follow my lessons, I can guarantee that you'll build a better life.

I'm not trying to teach you how to become a millionaire.

The only thing I can teach you is how to go from minimum wage to ₱35,000 a month.

What can you do with ₱35,000 a month?

I don't know. Save that and in five years that's 2.2M.

Don't count the money until after you're done the work.
