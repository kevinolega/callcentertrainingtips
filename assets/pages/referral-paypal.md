If you would like to send funds through Paypal, here's the link to my Paypal account.

Please take note that PayPal charges several transfer fees.

Based on experience PayPal charges 11.57% when we receive funds from another paypal account.

We would also need to pay $5 or â‚±200 to receive the funds from Paypal to our local bank.
