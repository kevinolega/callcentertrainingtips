I put together two groups of computations.

The first group of computations is about how many sentences I can write if I wrote consistently for fifteen minutes a day over six weeks, one year, five years, up to twenty years.

I also computed what would happen if I wrote a little longer.

I put computations for 30 minutes, 60 minutes, all the way up to eight hours of writing a day.

This computation is useful to consider when you're trying to learn a skill, and you feel that your progress is too slow.

The answer is ALWAYS to stay consistent.

## The Phone Coaching is NOT the Most Important Element of Your Lessons

The most important part of the lessons is you forming the habit of putting your ideas on paper in English.

If you continue writing every day, even fifteen minutes a day can give you a LOT of progress.

This computation also shows you how much writing you can finish if you stayed a little longer.

The second group of computations shows you how much money I made as a new freelance writer.

If you developed your communication skills to level seven and you want to earn money from your writing skills, this is how much money I received when I was starting.

I converted the computations into short essays, so if you'd prefer just to review the spreadsheets and skip the explanation, you may visit the spreadsheet.

I'm posting a link here for your reference.
