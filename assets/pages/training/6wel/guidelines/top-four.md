We've been offering these lessons since December of 2019.

We are tracking everybody's progress from enrollment to graduation.

Out of 100 students, only 30 people submit activities.

This is important.

Pay attention!

70 students paid us to teach them but quit without doing anything.

We did not receive any communication from the 70 of our 100 students.

When we follow up:

They tell us they got busy.

They tell us that they have something else to do.

They promise us they will send in the activities.

We keep everybody's record.

We follow up almost every week.

We never receive activities from these 70 people.

30 people have sent us their activities.

We receive about 30 answers to activity one.

We receive about 20 answers to activity two.

We receive about 15 answers to activity three.

We receive ten answers to activity four.

We receive about five answers to activity five.

Only four people out of 100 students get to complete the week one writing exercises.

Think about this very important statistic:

Out of 100 people, 96 people will quit during the first week.

Only four people finish week 1.

Now the good news.

One person quits during week 2.

Three people complete week 2.

One person quits on week 3.

The reason is that person got hired at a new job.

The two people who finish week 3 finish week 4 and the remaining activities.

One person will quit because he or she got hired.

So if you can survive week 1 and week 2, you should be skilled enough to communicate well and get hired.
