Thank you for patiently waiting for week 5.

I wanted to teach you how to sell.

If you're looking for work, knowing how to sell is a giant advantage during interviews.

If you're not looking for work, knowing how to sell will increase your ability to communicate.

I'm sharing a lot of stories on these lessons because I want to give you more ideas on how to tell stories.

I don't want you to admire me.

I want you to understand and eventually copy my techniques.

I want you to be the hero of your story.

I'm teaching you how I tell mine so you have an idea on how you can tell yours.

As always please answer the questions.

Thank you so much for supporting my page.

## Lesson 1 - Self Knowledge Activity

This is an activity that I keep in my notebook and I always read this before my interviews, dates and other important meetings.

## Lesson 6 - How to Cook Steak

Remember my question in week one about giving instructions? 

That's important. 

I use examples of teaching or giving instructions to win the most skeptical interviewers.

I teach them about something I learned in the gym, cooking, tech, martial arts.

I have won interviewers and regular people in social events.
