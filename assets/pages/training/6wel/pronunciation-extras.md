### 50% OF YOUR PRONUNCIATION PROBLEMS SOLVED

The top 100 most used English words are used more than 50% of the time. 

If your English is being judged, that means these 100 words are 50% of your pronunciation score.

We need to prioritize fixing your pronunciation here because if you speak one word incorrectly, you are likely going to repeat the same mistakes over and over during the interview.

### SIMPLE WORDS SHORT SENTENCES

Don't spend too much time creating a sentences. 

The first sentence that came to mind should work fine. 

We just wanted to make sure you understood these words and knew how to use them in a sentence.

If you found this part of the activity difficult, you probably made the mistake of trying to write long complicated sentences.

Short sentences will do.

The truck is red.

The bus is blue.

The tree is green.

### OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND SPEAK

The most important part of this activity is you should be able to say these words aloudx without any pronunciation errors.

### USE YOUR SMARTPHONE

When you get the chance, record yourself reading the one hundred words. 

Listen for errors and find the proper pronunciation.

Read both the number and the words.

I will be sending you a guide along with pronunciation tips.

### Play With Google Translate

You may use Google translate to find the pronunciation of the words.

Go to Google Translate and listen to each word and see how you compare.

### Speaking Tips 

When you speak:

You need to keep your back straight.

Your head should be facing forward or slightly upward.

DON’T LOOK DOWN WHILE SPEAKING.

Take deep breaths and smile before you speak.

### Tips about the numbers.

Twenty sounds like twenny

Thirty sounds like thirdy

Forty sounds like fordy

Seventy sounds like sevenny

Eighty sounds like eighdy

Ninety sounds like niney

#### Tips about the words:

There and their should sound almost the same. 

The only difference is their has a shorter i sound.

The most common errors are B and V sounds, P and F sounds, Th and D sounds.

### Words with common errors:

Here are some common mistakes that I encountered during the phone coaching.

The = shouldn’t sound like da. Please practice your “TH” sound.

Three

That

They

This

His = Try saying “his” with a shorter i sound and a z at the end. Hizz.

Have

Four = shouldn’t sound like pour. Please practice your “F” sound.

Fourteen

Seven = shouldn’t sound like seben. Please 
practice the “V” sound.

After = Open your mouth bigger as you speak the word “After”

All = open your mouth some more.

Would = Sounds like wood.

People

Into

Back = Open your mouth bigger as you make the a sound.

Use = Sounds like Uze

New = Sounds like Nu

We will discuss this on your third phone coaching session.

Please practice this until you can speak the words perfectly.
