I’m an introvert.

That means you can recognize that I am a shy person immediately after you meet me.

I also trained myself to become an extrovert because I read somewhere that extroverts get paid better and benefit from more opportunities than introverts.

After spending some time thinking about it, the idea that extroverts are able to receive more higher paying opportunities makes sense because people don't go out of their way to ask you about your interests, skills, potential contributions, and the possibility of working together on an opportunity.

If you don’t ask, you don’t get.

And successful people in business and the professional world are able to ask for opportunities, support, money and assistance, **ALMOST ALL THE TIME**.

And if you live your life not asking for anything, the extroverts are able to grab all the limited opportunities before you get the chance to.

What you’ll end up receiving are leftovers.

Not being able to approach opportunities and ask for what I want will mean that my options are limited to low paying jobs with little to no room for growth or promotion. 

So I trained myself to be an extrovert and actively looked for opportunities to teach myself how to get better in communicating my ideas and needs.

English, like any language, is a complex skill with many parts.

- **Reading and Comprehension**
- **Writing**
- **Speaking and Pronunciation**
- **Listening**
- **Words, Spelling and Vocabulary**
- **Grammar Rules and Sentence Construction**

In other words, there are a lot of things to consider.

As a result, many people who want to improve their English, slowly back down as soon as they find out the number of lessons that they need to cover.

If they’re brave, they study on their own but get nowhere because they study the wrong things.

**English has 171,416 words.**

Where do you start?

If you try the brute force method and only have a time limit of one year for studying English, you need to learn 470 words a day.

If you give yourself two years, that’s 235 words a day.

Three years and it’s 120 words a day.

Do you have that much time?

You also need to use words repetitively.

Watching movies won’t help either because there is very little repetition involved.

Movies do not count as practice, movies are primarily a form of entertainment.

So learning words once and not using it again after a certain period of time, means you’re going to forget it.

Back in grade school and high school English, every week, our teachers taught us 5-10 new words to add to our vocabulary.

Over a 10 year period (6 years grade school + 4 years high school) that’s about 2,500 to 5,000 words.

And because we only learned the new words and never used most of those words again, we forgot about most of those words.

One advantage of college is that over the four year period, you have the opportunity to use the same words (important to your field of study) over and over again.

If you’re studying a medical course, you’re studying the medical terms.

If you’re studying engineering, you’re learning concepts but you’re also becoming more and more familiar with the practical terms. 

If you’re learning IT or Computer Science, you’re limited to tech words.

If you’re studying law, you’re limited to legal terms for contracts and legal related activities.

## So what’s the solution?

> I don’t fear the opponent who knows 10,000 techniques.
> I fear the man who practiced one technique 10,000 times.
> - Bruce Lee (paraphrased)

**In order to be fluent in a language, you need to be competent with the use of the 3,000 most commonly used words.**

Three thousand words is a lot less than one hundred and seventy one thousand four hundred and sixteen.

Here’s more good news.

**Out of three thousand words, one hundred words is used more than fifty percent of the time.**

What does that mean?

If you can learn to use and speak two words a day for the next six weeks, you already boosted your English skills by an extra 50%.

So if your current English skill is at 30%, then at the end of our lessons, you should be closer to 70% or 80% fluent if you follow our activities.

I had bad English grades despite watching a lot of English shows, playing lots of English games and reading English books and comic books.

I taught myself to be good in English.

**I trained myself to become an English Speaking Extrovert by writing things down.**

Even after starting with bad English…

I have made my living, earning from jobs that required good English communication skills.

- Gun store sales executive.
- Insurance company promo/marketing staff.
- Property salesperson for one of the largest real estate companies in the Philippines.
- Financial planner for a large insurance company.
- English teacher to Koreans.
- Outbound call center agent.
- Office manager for a Call Center Training School.
- Operations manager for a small call center.
- Product consultant and trainer for a health and skin care company.
- Account manager for recruitment services
- Sales and marketing executive for InfoTech.
- L2 customer account executive: L10 agent - Subject Matter Expert.
- I became a writer for several foreign websites.
- I became a project manager for an IT company.
- I’m still growing.

The funny thing is that writing is an introverts preferred activity. 

I wrote things down because it’s the easiest thing for me to do.

When you write, you have the following advantages:

The most practical benefit is you can see your ideas.

You have all the time in the world to think of your answer.

If you don’t have an answer, you can pause and come back to the question to give your answer. 

You can even ask other people for help.

You can edit your answers.

You can study your answers.

You can edit as many times as you need.

You can rewrite your answers.

You have a reference that you can practice when you speak.

You can always come back, repeat the process and craft better answers.

My favorite part about writing is you can collect ideas that will make your life better.

I’m a believer that the right idea, at the right time can change your life.

In a call center job, you’re going to do a LOT of speaking.

If you’re a naturally good speaker, then you don’t need this training program.

If you’re not a naturally good speaker, then chances are you’re naturally better at writing.

Let’s start with that. 

Let's transform your ability from a six to a seven to an eight to a nine and eventually a ten.

Let's work on your writing ability so it becomes so high, it positively influences your speaking ability.

And also I have a shortcut.

And it starts with writing.

And with a few small changes, your speaking will be a lot better too.

This training program will help you prepare your interview answers and prepare you for daily conversations in the professional world.

Answer each question of every activity.

That said, you can practice writing your answers, stories, questions and instructions, improve them and when they are perfect you have a script to use.
