Your actual performance is influenced by both your skill level and confidence level.

If your skill level is low and your confidence is low, your performance is also low.

Having some confidence helps you a little, even if you have low skills. 

Unfortunately, even if your confidence level is high, if your skill is low, that's as high as you can go.

If you have average skills and your confidence is low, your actual skill level doesn't come out.

This situation is often known as stage freight or performance anxiety.

Average skills and average confidence will get you average performance.

Average skill benefits from higher confidence because your skill level will mirror your confidence level.

Low confidence kills your ability to perform well, even if you have higher-level skills.

No matter how skilled you are, your performance receives a penalty whenever you doubt yourself.

Paying attention to both your skill level and confidence level will help you reach maximum performance.
