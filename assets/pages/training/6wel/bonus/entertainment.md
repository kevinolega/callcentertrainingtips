I also fall victim to procrastination.

When I finally got an iPhone, I downloaded all the cool free iOS games.

When I got my credit card, I ended up buying some games.

I did the same thing on Android.

### The Technology That Can Improve Your Life Can Also Destroy Your Life

I max leveled my accounts on Infinity Blade, Injustice: gods among us, Plants vs. Zombies, Summoner's War, Mask of Ninja, Vikings, BoxHead, Adventure Time, RobotnGun, Predators, and dozens of more games.

I did the same when I got an Android Phone.

I saw How I Met Your Mother, Game of Thrones, Naruto, Fairy Tail, Dexter, Hannibal, Suits, and more, all on my phone.

### I was a time management disaster.

If you look at the history of my public writing, you'll notice that I wrote consistently for months, and there are periods of time when I didn't write for longer than a month.

I could be writing more.

I could be providing more value.

I could be improving my skills.

I could be investing my time better.

Instead, I spent hours entertaining myself.

There is nothing wrong with entertainment.

It's the same statement as there's nothing wrong with food.

The problem comes from spending too much time on things that give you short term joy and very little time on activities that give you long term gain.

Google the tale of the ant and the grasshopper.

You might learn something.

### What Makes You Happy Now Won't Make You Most Happy

If the ratio is wrong, then you are heading toward disaster.

If you eat a chocolate bar three times a day or a mountain of rice during breakfast, lunch, and dinner, your organs will eventually fail.

In the same way, if you spend more time with activities that give you entertainment, both your career and finances will fail.

Just like the human body, where one system fails, the whole body dies.

Failing to get a reputable source of income hurts your relationships, family, mental well-being, self-confidence, friendships, spiritual life, health, happiness, and more.

I learned a few interesting things from the shows that I've seen, but I regret spending too much time.

I regret watching the shows over and over again.

Not everyone can earn a living from having an encyclopedic knowledge of Naruto, Star Wars, and a bunch of old computer games.

Some can, but not everyone.

### Time Is Money - That's True

When I reached the point that I earned dollars per hour, I began to realize that my time had value.

The estimated time I spent watching Game of Thrones is 63 hours.

The estimated time I spent watching Naruto is 240 hours.

The estimated time I spent watching How I Met Your Mother is 80 hours.

These hours are based on the total playtime of the series.

This does not include the times I re-watched episodes.

### Free Entertainment is Not Free

It's embarrassing to admit that I re-watched these shows several times.

As a call center agent, I made approximately $3/hour or ₱ 150 an hour.

If you multiply the hours by your hourly rate, you'll realize how much it costs to watch a TV show.

Game of Thrones costs ₱ 9,450 to watch if you're earning a call center salary.

Naruto costs ₱36,000 to watch if you're earning a call center salary.

How I Met Your Mother costs ₱12,000.

### How Many Hours Do You Spend On Your Phone?

My iPhone has a feature that logs my phone use.

Some days I'm on Facebook 6 hours a day.

Some days I'm watching YouTube for 8 hours a day.

Some days, I'm playing a game for 11 hours a day.

I'll let you compute how much these are on your own.

Let's just keep the hours to a minimum.

I'll go on Facebook for two hours a day, YouTube for an hour a day, and perhaps play a couple of games of Dota for two hours a day or six Mobile Legends game for two hours.

Five hours a day for a year is ₱ 273,750.

	Here's the formula:

	HOURS x 365 x Hourly Rate(₱ 150)

### I lost a million pesos to social media

When you begin to earn $5 an hour or $10 an hour, it's a different story.

In 2020 rewatching GOT, HIMYM and Naruto cost ₱210,000.

Rewatching all the MCU films from Ironman to Endgame costs ₱ 27,500.

Wasting five hours a day watching YT or scrolling FB, IG, and playing a game will cost ₱1,003,750 at the end of the year.

#### What could you have done to this amount of money?

I did this for a few years.

I got a few things done.

But now that I realize all the time I wasted.

I also realize the opportunity that I wasted.

I don't want you to make the same mistakes.

I want you to invest your time so you can make your life better.

### Invest Your Time. 

Here are some ideas:

You can use your spare hours for something better than overtime at work.

Learn a skill that will help you earn more money.

Learn the skill that you are not very good at your job.

Not good at English? Get someone to teach you.

Not good with computers? Get someone to teach you.

Not good at writing letters? Get someone to teach you.

Not good at sales? Get someone to teach you.

Not good at managing your time? Get someone to teach you.

Anything that you need to know can be learned.

Learn the skill needed so you can qualify for a promotion.

Learn the missing skill so you can qualify for high paying jobs.

Do some freelance work with your hobbies and interests. 

Be a better writer. 

Use technology wisely.

Learn a skill that will help you save money on expenses.

Ride a bike, exercise at home, cook your own food.

So it's 2020, I'm 35, and now I realize a bright future requires a big sacrifice.

I'm now strongly thinking thoughts that the younger me would disagree with.

### I now believe...

Getting my own Nintendo Switch is the enemy.

Buying a PlayStation or Xbox is the enemy.

Playing games is the enemy.

Spending time on YouTube for entertainment is the enemy.

Netflix is the enemy.

Endlessly scrolling Facebook and IG is the enemy.

Entertainment is the enemy.
