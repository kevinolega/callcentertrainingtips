Break Stuff

## Break Bad Habits

Here's a list of bad habits we picked up in school.

1. Compound and Complex Sentences
2. Paragraph with Several Sentences
3. Complicated or Advanced Words

These habits previously impressed our English teacher and allowed us to graduate from high school.



### Break Complicated Sentences

A compound sentence has two or more independent clauses connected by a comma, semicolon or conjunction. 

An independent clause has a subject and verb and forms a complete thought.

> Kevin did not cheat on the test, for it was the wrong thing to do.

A complex sentence is a sentence that contains an independent clause and one or more dependent clauses. 

An independent clause can stand alone as a sentence. 

A dependent clause has a subject and a verb but cannot stand alone.

- Because my coffee was too cold, I heated it in the microwave.
- Although he was wealthy, he was still unhappy.
- She returned the computer after she noticed it was damaged.
- Whenever prices goes up, customers buy less products.

Compund and complex sentences are sentences with multiple ideas.

A complex sentence is, of course, just one type of sentence we can use in writing. The four types of sentence are discussed below:

Complex Sentence
As we have mentioned, a complex sentence is one with an independent clause and at least one dependent clause.

Example:

Whenever he was lonely, Lance called his mother.
Compound Sentence
A compound sentence is one with two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (for, but, and, nor, or, yet, so).

Example:

I was born in the United States, yet I consider myself Canadian.
A Simple Sentence
A simple sentence is one with only one independent clause and no dependent clauses.

Example:

David drives carefully to work in the morning.
A Compound-Complex Sentence
A compound-complex sentence is one with at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.

Jim doesnâ€™t drink beer because he has a gluten allergy, so he tends to drink wine most weekends.

### What to do?

Don't combine multiple thoughts in one senctence.

Use short simple sentences.

If you discover that you have written a complicated sentence, break that sentence down.

Write several short simple sentences.
