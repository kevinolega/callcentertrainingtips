Please select a schedule from the calendar.

Write your questions on Google Docs. 

Transfer your answers to Google Docs if you submitted your answers using PDF of MS Word.

Include how many sessions we've had and remind me of your goals for the session.

NOTE: I check the schedule the night before or first thing in the morning. 

Please avoid scheduling the same day.

Same day schedules are not guaranteed.

I'll send you an email if we need to reschedule.
