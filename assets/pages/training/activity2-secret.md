Here are my goals for Lesson 2:

## 1. GET USED TO ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS.

You'll answer these questions when you meet someone new.

You'll answer these questions during an interview.

You'll answer these questions in social situations.

You can fix your grammar on paper.

Your spoken answer will sound a lot better.


## 2. GET USED TO ASKING THESE QUESTIONS.

You'll ask these questions when you meet someone new.

You'll ask some of these questions to your interviewer.

You'll ask these questions during social gatherings.

I already phrased the grammar correctly.

Your main goal is to pronounce the question properly.

How do you sound?

Are you already comfortable asking these questions?

Do you sound casual when you ask these questions?

Are you smiling as you ask these questions?

## 3. QUESTIONS HELP YOU ANSWER DIFFICULT PROBLEMS.

I've spoken to several people who have a tough time answering call center interview questions.

I've gotten stuck with many questions.

I can't talk abouit "tell me something about yourself."

I've gotten stuck with talking about "strengths and weaknesses.""

I don't have confidence.

I can't answer "why the company should hire me."

Okay.

This is another secret.

The questions in activity 2 help you answer "tell me someting about yourself."

Consider the following questions.

- What’s your name?
- What’s your nickname?
- Where are you from?
- Where do you live?
- What do you enjoy doing?
- How do you spend your free time?
- Where did you go to school?
- What course did you study?
- Where do you work?
- What kind of work do you do?
- Where do you go to church?
- What kind of sports do you engage in?
- How old are you?
- How many siblings do you have?
- What’s your family business?

Answering all these questions can help you design an answer to "tell me something about yourself."

The secret here is this idea.

Difficult questions are not just one question.

Difficult problems are not just one problem.

It's easier to answer many small questions to build a good answer to a complex question.

We use questions to dismantle complex problems.

## HOW TO CONVERT WEAKNESS INTO AN ADVANTAGE

Here's another example.

I use these same set of questions to complex questions like:

Why should I hire you?

What are your strengths?

What are your weaknesses?

What are your advantages over the other applicants?

What are your weakness and strengths?

- How many jobs have you had? 
- What was your first job? 
- What was your second job? 
- What was your third job? 
- What was your fourth job?
- What was your fifth job? 
- What was your sixth job?
- What are your responsibilities at your job?  
- Share a short story about a negative experience from work.
- Share a short story about an attitude that changed.
- Share a short story about a bad habit that you removed.
- Share a short story about a skill that you learned.
- Share a short story about a lesson that you learned.

I use this set of questions when working with people who have no work experience.

- Where did you study?
- Who are your friends?
- Who are the people that you look up to?
- What skills do you have?
- What organizations or groups did you belong to?
- What hobbies or activities are you passionate about?
- Share a negative experience.
- Share a short story about how you changed your attitude.
- Share a story about 
- Share a story about how you learned a skill.
- Share a story about a lesson that you learned.


Here's the outline of the story that I'm trying to build.

My supervisor gave me another chance.

The client was patient and allowed me to try again.

STRUGGLE:

SUMMARY:

I wouldn't be where I am without the weakness.

The weakness taught me that I just needed to learn a skill.

It's difficult to learn new skills.

Changing my attitude gets me on the right path.

Learning new skills allows me to accomplish more tasks.

Skills provide solutions to problems.

I'm no longer afraid of facing failure.

I just need to be persistent and learn a new skill.

I'll share some video samples of how I taught these technique to my students.
