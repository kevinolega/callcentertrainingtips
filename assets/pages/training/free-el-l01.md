## LESSONS

### WRITING BEFORE SPEAKING

Grammar problems are easier to spot on paper.

<details>
	<summary>Read more.</summary>
	<p>Write as if you are speaking to another person.</p>
	<p>Practice writing everything that you want to say.</p>
	<p>Include all the details.</p>
	<p>Fix the grammar on paper.</p>

</details>

### CAPITALIZATION AND PUNCTUATION

A sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a period.

<details>
	<summary>Read more.</summary>
	<p>A sentence always begins with a capital letter.</p>
	<p>Proper nouns such as names, places, things, and events begin with a capital letter.</p>
	<p>Kevin, Parañaque City, Philippines, West Contact Services, and other proper nouns are written as capital letters.</p>
	<p>Sentences need to end with a punctuation marke like a period, question mark, or exclamation point.</p>
	<p>Failing to do so will give interviewers a bad impression of your communication skills.</p>

</details>

### USE TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS

You're allowed to use tools if you don't know how to answer.

<details>
	<summary>Read more.</summary>
	<p>Use the built-in spelling and grammar checker on Google Docs.</p>
	<p>Use the free Grammarly.com service.</p>
	<p>Google words that you don't know.</p>
	<p>Use Google Translate to get ideas on how to communicate your message.</p>
	<p>Tools help spot 90% of your errors.</p>
	<p>Using tools is not cheating.</p>
	<p><a href="https://callcentertrainingtips.com/grammar-tools">FURTHER READING: LINK TO LESSON</a></p>
</details>

### WRITING METHOD

I use both paper and computer to improve my communication skills.

<details>
	<summary>Read more.</summary>
	<p>I write my ideas on scratch paper.</p>
	<p>I rewrite important ideas in my notebook.</p>
	<p>I format and encode my writing on my computer.</p>
	<p>I record what I said using my phone.</p>
	<p>I listen to how I sound and write ideas on how to improve my communciation.</p>
	<p>I repeat the process until I'm happy with my message.</p>
	<p><a href="">FURTHER READING: LINK TO LESSON</a></p>
</details>

### TAGLISH AND ENGLISH

I get stuck too. I'll share my technique.

<details>
	<summary>Read more.</summary>
	<p>Write your ideas in Taglish.</p>
	<p>Convert your sentences into English.</p>
	<p>Rewrite your ideas until you are happy with the communication.</p>
	<p>Ideas are easier to process on paper than in your head.</p>
	<p>Always write your ideas even if it's in Filipino, you can always translate if you need to.</p>
	<p><a href="">FURTHER READING: LINK TO LESSON</a></p>
</details>

### ONE SENTENCE PARAGRAPH

This technique fixes 90% of your grammar problems.

<details>
	<summary>Read more.</summary>
	<p>Don't waste your effort composing paragraphs with five or more sentences.</p>
	<p>Treat each sentence like a paragraph.</p>
	<p>Include a space above and below your sentence.</p>
	<p>Give each sentence it's own line.</p>
	<p>You'll easily spot grammar problems when you write in this format.</p>
	<p><a href="">FURTHER READING: LINK TO LESSON</a></p>
</details>

### SHORTEN SENTENCES

Long sentences make you sound stupid. I'll share a better way to communicate.

<details>
	<summary>Read more.</summary>
	<p>Don't put all your ideas in one sencences.</p>
	<p>Keep your sentences short and simple.</p>
	<p>Avoid exceeding seven to eleven words when writing sentences.</p>
	<p>Each sentence should only have one idea.</p>
	<p>Ideas will flow smoother after you learn this lesson.</p>
	<p><a href="">FURTHER READING: LINK TO LESSON</a></p>
</details>


### LONGER SHORTER RULES

People claim that they're good at writing but bad at speaking. Your speaking skills actually mirror the quality of words that you can write.

<details>
	<summary>Read more.</summary>
	<p>Write longer then shorter.</p>
	<p>I write 100 sentences about myself.</p>
	<p>I select the best fifty sentences that I can use in interviews.</p>
	<p>I then select the best twenty sentences that will impress the interviewer.</p>
	<p>I finally select five sentences to introduce myself to the interviewer.</p>
	<p>I use the remaining sentences to answer follow-up questions.</p>
	<p>My name is Kevin.</p>
	<p>I live in Parañaque.</p>
	<p>My previous job was sales.</p>
	<p>I enjoy writing, exercising, and reading books.</p>
	<p>I want to work in a call center to earn ₱30,000 a month.</p>
	<p><a href="">FURTHER READING: LINK TO LESSON</a></p>
</details>

### COMPLETE YOUR SENTENCES

My name is Kevin. I live in Parañaque. I write complete sentences.

<details>
	<summary>Read more.</summary>
	<p>A sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation mark.</p>
	<p>A sentence needs to have a subject.</p>
	<p>A sentence needs to have a verb.</p>
	<p>A sentence needs to have an object or receiver of the action.</p>
	<p>Write complete sentences.</p>
	<p>Avoid speaking in phrases.</p>
	<p><a href="">FURTHER READING: LINK TO LESSON</a></p>
</details>

### BE SPECIFIC

Avoid pronouns and words that don't communicate what you want to communicate. 

<details>
	<summary>Read more.</summary>
	<p>It's always a good idea to avoid pronouns. </p>
	<p>Overused pronouns create problems because you can get confused.</p>
	<p>He did it after going there.</p>
	<p>Who did what? What did he do? Where did he go?</p>
	<p>Kevin ate at the restaurant after going to the gym.</p>
	<p>Avoid using pronouns to avoid confusion.</p>
	<p><a href="">FURTHER READING: LINK TO LESSON</a></p>
</details>

### READ ALOUD

This is a low-tech way to effectively check if you are ready.

<details>
	<summary>Read more.</summary>
	<p>We sometimes don't have access to a spelling and grammar check software.</p>
	<p>Read what you've written aloud.</p>
	<p>Listen to how your writing sounds.</p>
	<p>Are you happy with how the message is delivered?</p>
	<p>Read your writing aloud.</p>
