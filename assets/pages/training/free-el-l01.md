	<br>
	<br>
	<p>A sentence always begins with a capital letter.</p>
	<p>Proper nouns such as names, places, things, and events begin with a capital letter.</p>
	<p>Kevin, Parañaque City, Philippines, West Contact Services, and other proper nouns are written as capital letters.</p>
	<p>Sentences need to end with a punctuation marke like a period, question mark, or exclamation point.</p>
