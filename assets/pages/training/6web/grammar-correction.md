You've followed several grammar rules successfully up to this point.

Let's discuss what you may be doing wrong.

## LESSONS FROM GEORGE ORWELL

George Orwell has six rules for writing.

1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech tht you're used to seeing in print.
2. Never use a long word where a short word will do.
3. If it's possible to cut a word out, cut the word out.
4. Never use passive voice where you can use active voice.
5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

Keep your writing simple, brief, active, free of clich√©s, and to the point.

Use your best judgement.

Here's a list of the most common errors that I've encountered from checking thousands of writing exercises.

## OVERUSED PRONOUNS

Overused pronouns make your message more confusing.

Check your work for the following overused pronouns:

It and It's.

This and That.

Them.

He and She.

Make your message more specific.

Include the missing detail that you left out.

Remove the pronoun and return the specific detail.

## REMOVE UNNECESSARY WORDS

Do not begin your sentences with these words:

Way back...

And...

Or...

But...

Because...

So...


Remove these words to sound more confident:

Just...

Like...

Sort of...

Kind of...

Maybe...

Perhaps...

Might...

Can...

These words are called weasel words.

Weasel words make you sound unsure of yourself.

In some cases, you can use these words but most of the time, these words don't help you present an idea clearly or make an argument.


## AVOID ADVERBS

Do not begin your sentences with the following words:

Actually

Basically

Currently

Presently

Really

Suddenly

Virtually.

Read the sentence without the adverbs when you find these words in your sentence. 

If the meaning of the sentence does not change, remove the adverbs.

Using this words make your message sound like an exaggeration.

Avoid using adverbs.

## THINGS

Anything

Everything

Make your verbs stronger whenever possible.
