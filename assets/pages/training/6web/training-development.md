<p>Please do not include personal info like your complete name, and complete address in your answers.</p>
<p>Your first name or nickname is fine for all of our questions.</p>
<p>Do not say: My name is James Kevin Olega. You may call me Kevin for short.</p>
<p>Say: My name is Kevin.</p>

5. Read your answers aloud before submitting.
6. Use simple words.

<p><strong>English became more exhibition instead of communication back in junior and senior high school.</strong></p>
<p>Your English needs to focus on communication instead of exhibition to succeed as a professional.</p>
<p>Your goal is to convey simple messages.</p>
<p><strong>AVOID:</strong></p>

1. Big paragraphs.
2. Compound, complex, and long, compound-complex sentences.
3. Fancy or complicated words.

<p>Our goal is to reinforce your understanding of the basic rules.</p>
<p>You can go back to adding flair to your communication after you've mastered the basics.</p>
