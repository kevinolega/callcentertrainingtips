Let's practice telling some stories.

I want you to pull out your phone.

Go to your photo gallery.

If you're using an iPhone, go to the Photos app.

If you're using an Android phone, go to the Gallery or File Manager.

If you back up your photos on Google Photos or the Facebook app, please go to the photo gallery of those apps.

If you empty your phone and keep everything on a computer or a separate hard drive, go to your photos folder or wherever you keep your photos.

If you keep your favorite photos on Instagram, select your photos there.

If you don't have any digital photos get your photo albums.

I want you to list down 20 photos.

You're free to select any photo that you have.

You're free to select from any source.

Make it interesting.

I want you to describe what's in each photo using one or two sentences.

Here are some examples.

1. I have a photo of my black dog with white paws and brown eyes looking straight at the camera. My dog is a cross between a Shih-Tzu and a Poodle, and he just had a haircut so you won't be able to figure out his breed on the first look.
2. I have a photo of Guts, my favorite anime character, pointing his cannon directly at my screen. The art is black and white.
3. I have a photo of myself deadlifting 360lbs at a CrossFit event. I was wearing the gym shoes that my dad gave me.
4. I have a before and after photo of myself the fat, depressed version of myself from 2015 and a more fit version of myself in 2017 after I started going to the gym, riding my bike, and participating in CrossFit.
5. I have an artwork of myself drawn by my friend Michael Urbano. It was drawn during my mountaineering days, so I'm wearing mountain gear, and he made me look like a serial killer because I was kneeling over what looks like a dead body in the artwork. He likes inking and shadows, and he kind of drew me like Gambit from the X-Men comic books.
6. I have an artwork of myself drawn by the artist Odree. I'm wearing my usual clothes, and I look like a Chibi anime character with a big head and short arms and legs.
7. I have a photo of my race bike leaning against our green gate. My bike is a gray fixed-gear bike with a Colossi frame and SRAM parts.

I already gave you some examples.

Keep going until you reach 20.

## Part Two 

Select two photos from your list.

Write a story about that photo.

Write 10-20 sentences for each story.

Remember to use the one-sentence paragraph format.

Remember to write shorter sentences whenever possible.

Remember to simplify the words because your reader may not have the same experience as you and can't see your photo or story.

Do your best to give as many details as you can.


In 2015, I decided to make my life better.

I was listening to Tony Robbins, and he told a story about an experiment that helped people overcome depression.

I learned that people who took care of their bodies could fight depression, and people who had poor health and self-care practices are easily affected by depression.

He recommended fixing your posture, doing breathing exercises, and smiling to get started.

I became a top performer in the exact same week following that advice.

He recommended that I begin to eat healthily, more greens, and natural food and slowly cut out junk food.

He also recommended going to the gym.

When I got to the gym, I took a topless before and after photo of myself.

It's my first bathroom mirror selfie.

The gym had a huge mirror and good lighting so you can see how fat I was.

I slowly stopped smoking after going to the gym.

I began to feel more competent.

I began to perform better and received another top-agent award at work.

I met good people and received good advice in the gym.

I even met a couple of big celebrities who gave me high targets to reach for and encouraged me to follow a healthy diet.

I eventually used the money that I saved to get a computer and get started working from home.

But that's for another story.

I kept going to the gym and continued to get better at my work.

In 2017, I took another bathroom mirror selfie.

I put together the two photos.

I usually can't feel my progress on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, so I always feel discouraged, but after a couple of years, I could see a big difference.

I'm glad I kept going.

This is the reason why I can confidently recommend that when you are learning a skill, you should give it a few years and keep going.

Now it's your turn.

## Activity:

1. Describe 20 photos with one to two sentences.

2. Select two photos and tell me a ten to twenty sentence story for each photo.
