I recorded several videos for the pronunciation module.

The first video is me explaining the lesson.

The second video is me working with a student.

The third video is me working with another student.

Both students have different pronunciation errors.

I want you to be familliar with how to say words properly.

I also want you to be aware with how mistakes are made when speaking the words. 

Please watch all three videos.

Watch the videos multiple times until you're 100% comfortable with speaking all 100 of the Top Most Used English words.

Please refer to the two downloadable PDF's that we shared during Week 1 and Week 2.

## Good Body Mechanics

1. Sit or Stand Straight.
2. Look Forward (or slightly upward)
3. Breathe properly.
4. Smile before speaking.
5. Adjust your volume depending on your personality.

### Introvert or Extrovert?

Are you an introvert or an extrovert?

If you're an extrovert, chances are, many of my lessons are already "common sense to you."

If you're having trouble with your communication, then chances are you're an introvert like me.

If you're an introvert, here's an extra step that I'd like you to take.

I'd like you to use your maximum speaking volume.

Pretend you're speaking to someone on the other end of the room.

If you're talking to someone in person, pretend you're speaking to someone behind that person.

Introverts like us naturally speak softly.

Your voice needs to be "loud and clear" for many high-paying jobs like call center work.

## Fixing Errors

### B and V

B sound requires closed lips.

V sound requires that you form the rabbit position with your mouth. 

You'll notice a slight vibration with your lips and teeth when you make the V sound.

### P and F

P sound requires closed lips.

F sound requires that you form the rabbit position with your mouth.

You'll notice a slight vibration with your lips and teeth when you make the F sound.


### Th and D

There's a similar relationship with the B and V, P and F, and TH and D.

When you make the D sound, your tongue fully sticks to the roof of your mouth.

When you make the TH sound, the tip of your tongue will slightly stick to the roof of your mouth. 

You will also feel a slight vibration unlike the D sound.

Examples are:

The, There, Then, Them, That.

### TH and T

Sometimes we make the T sound instead of the TH sound.

We say tree instead of Three.

Be careful of that potential mistake.
