Activity:

Write down the words you are guilty of using.

Write down a simpler word that you can use instead.

Please write examples of you using the words in the sentences.

Please write words that you'll use instead.

**For example**:

I discovered in this lesson that overusing "noted" is considered outdated office language.

You want to avoid using office words when talking to customers.

Moving forward, I'll stop using "noted" in my conversations.

I'll say "got you," "okay," and "I understand" instead of "noted."

You may write sentences like these as you explain the words that you'll stop using.

Writing sentences like these will help you remember and eventually replace the overused words with better alternatives.
