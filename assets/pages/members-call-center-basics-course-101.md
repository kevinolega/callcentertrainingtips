## CALL CENTER BASICS VIDEOS


I have three public videos on call center basics.

I discuss call center basics in this video that you need to know when you're looking for work. 

I talk more about important details on the second video.

I talk about how to set goals and use goals to convince the interviewer to hire you in the third video.
