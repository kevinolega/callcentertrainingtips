<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">Why do I need to pay if I can watch YouTube or read your lessons for free?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">While free resources like YouTube and online lessons can be helpful, paying for training offers personalized feedback and guidance.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Communication is complex, and learning it on your own can be challenging. Different situations require different levels of English skills.</p>
<p style="color:black;">For example, call center work in business-to-customer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) settings requires different skill levels, as does online freelancing.</p>
