<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">What do I get when I join your program?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">When you join our program, you'll get training materials, writing exercises, video guides, and live coaching sessions.</p>
<p style="color:black;">We'll work on your communication skills, fix your grammar and pronunciation, and help you become more confident by the end of the program.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">What is the training schedule?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">You can do the writing exercises anytime you want. We suggest studying for 30 minutes to an hour daily if you can. But you can work on your modules when you're free.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Right now, we only have Sunday sessions.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Sunday Schedule:</p>
<ul>
	<li>6 pm to 7 pm</li>
	<li>8 pm to 9 pm</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:black;">We understand you might have a different schedule. We're working on more options for students. If you have questions or want a different time, <a href="https://facebook.com/callcentertrainingtips">send us a message</a>.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">Why do you use writing exercises?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">We use writing exercises because they help improve your grammar at your own pace.</p>
<p style="color:black;">It's easier to spot and fix grammar mistakes in writing.</p>
<p style="color:black;">We'll look at your writing, one sentence at a time. You'll read each sentence out loud, and we'll fix your grammar and pronunciation.</p>
<p style="color:black;">I'll teach you ways to make your sentences better and sound more professional.</p>
<p style="color:black;">We suggest setting aside 30-45 minutes each day for writing.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">Can I see samples of your sessions?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">Sure! Here's a <a href="https://callcentertrainingtips.com/videos">link to sample sessions in video format</a>.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">Will you guarantee that I'll improve and get hired after I pay?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">Improvement and success depend on your active participation.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Your lessons involve more than just paying, reading, and watching videos after you join</p>
<p style="color:black;">To sharpen your communication skills, you must participate in the writing exercises and group sessions</p>
<p style="color:black;">It's essential to read and follow all the instructions carefully.</p>
<p style="color:black;">For maximum results, I recommend giving your best effort to complete all the written exercises and being punctual for all sessions.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">Why do I need to pay if I can watch YouTube or read your lessons for free?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">While free resources like YouTube and online lessons can be helpful, paying for training offers personalized feedback and guidance.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Communication is complex, and learning it on your own can be challenging. Different situations require different levels of English skills.</p>
<p style="color:black;">For example, call center work in business-to-customer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) settings requires different skill levels, as does online freelancing.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Improving your communication skills can lead to better job opportunities and higher pay. It can also help you avoid misunderstandings and lost opportunities in both business and personal relationships.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Training is not a magic ticket that automatically grants you new skills or guarantees a job. Instead, it's a service that provides valuable lessons, guidance, feedback, and correction to help you grow and improve your communication abilities.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">Do I need to pay for the session before I start the training?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">Yes, you need to pay for the session before you can join the sessions. This ensures you have access to all the resources, feedback, and guidance offered in the program.</p>
