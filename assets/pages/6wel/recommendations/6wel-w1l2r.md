Here are some additional recommendations so you can get the maximum benefit from Lesson 2.

Please read this multiple times and go back to your answers and make the needed changes.

## Always Take Notes

Make it a practice to write down everything that you learned so the lessons will stay with you.

Memory is undependable unless you're dealing with traumatic experiences.

For everything else, you need to write it down.

## Focus on Solutions

Don't focus on the problem.

Focus on the solution.

Avoid saying that you are not good at English. 

You are learning to improve your English by practicing every day. 

You are writing regularly and looking for opportunities to practice with an English speaker.

You no longer have the right to say that you are not good at English.

## Your Answers Can Evolve

Don't just read something once and answer a question once.

Reread your answer.

How does the answer sound?

Are you happy with your answer?

Important questions need to be revisited because our answers change as our situation and values change.

### Ask yourself the following questions

How can I make my answer more specific?

How can I communicate this better?

What words can I simplify?

What sentences can I shorten?

What ideas can I separate into multiple sentences?

What ideas can I elaborate on?

What other details can I improve?

Do your best to be specific to improve your answers. 

Avoid one-word answers and short phrases.

### Write Longer Answers

During practice mode, you want to make your answers as long as possible.

During your interview, you want to select your best answers for the interviewer.

When your interviewer hears something interesting, they will ask you to elaborate and explain your answer.

Different interviewers will also find different areas of your story more interesting.

If you don't have the full English version of your story or instruction, you are not going to deliver your answer well.

Translating your answers from Filipino to English during the interview doesn't result in clear or confident communication.

Then you'll fail the interview.

The interviewer will write the words "poor communication skills" on your resume and use that as the reason why they rejected you.

### Avoid Opening with Positive Traits

It is incredibly tempting to answer many interview questions with your positive traits. Still, we discovered that stories are the best answers to these questions. 

I previously conducted interviews with our company.

I'm instructed to ask several follow up questions to make sure that the applicant is telling the truth about their positive trait.

Whenever we hear these words, we had prepared to follow up questions to check if the applicant is telling the truth.

Often, when we begin asking to follow up questions, the applicant received six additional follow up questions.

Your answers need to be consistent and connected.

If your values and experience don't match the values of the person whom you copied your answer, you're going to sound inconsistent to trained hiring professionals.

Your copied answers may sound better than your real answer but may destroy your opportunity because it's not real.

#### I want to work in a call center because of the high salary!

- Why do you want to work in a call center?
- What is your expected salary?
- How much were you earning, and how much more - do you need?
- What would you need the additional income for?
- Why is that important to you?

#### I want to work in a call center because I have the skills!

- What do you know about call center work?
- What skills do you already have, and what skills are missing? If you say poor communication skills in English here, the interview is over.
- Discuss with me the skills and attitude you learned in your past job, which helps you become good at call center work.
- What positive traits does your boss say about you?
- Were you always (POSITIVE TRAIT) what's the story of how you became (POSITIVE TRAIT).
- Tell me a story about your accomplishments related to (POSITIVE TRAIT or SKILL).
- How do you handle failure?

#### Dedicated

We ask the applicant to share a story about a time you had to choose work over personal commitments.

#### Hardworking

We ask the applicant to share a story about your most prolonged overtime.

#### Reliable

We ask the applicant to share a story about what you do to avoid work-related mistakes.

#### Flexible

We ask the applicant to share a story about a time that you had to do work that is not related to your job description.

#### Strong work ethic

We ask the applicant to tell a story about a time where you were supposed to do a task that you personally don't feel like doing.

#### Ambitious

We ask the applicant to share what your personal and professional goals are, and what is the story behind your goals?

#### Loyal

We ask the applicant to share a story about how you quit your last three jobs.

#### Disciplined

We ask the applicant to share and describe your day to day routine and how you manage your time and tasks.

There are more.

The idea is if you open with a positive trait, the natural response is to put you in a spot to prove that you really have a positive quality.

HR and Recruitment professionals are often psychology graduates, so they have the training to spot job applicants giving fake answers.

The reason why I gave you a lot to write is so you can speak comfortably and confidently because you have excellent product knowledge about yourself. 

### Stories Communicate Positive Traits

After writing dozens of stories to prepare or my job application, I discovered that my strengths, weakness, stories, and skills are all connected.

Every skill that I'm good at is often connected to a past weakness.

Every success is connected to past failures.

At the moment, these connections are invisible, but if you look at your past carefully, you'll find the connection.

#### I'm the hero of my story

The story is simply the journey from the time I discovered my weakness to the time that I developed my strength.

This is very much like the story of many comic book superheroes.

Tony Stak was captured by terrorists and forced to produce a weapon. Instead of building a missile, he made a suit of armor to escape then he later used the suit to fight bad guys as Ironman.

Bruce Wayne lost his parents when he was a kid, he studied to become the world's greatest detective, martial artist, and athlete to fight crime.

Bruce Banner almost died in a science experiment, and he got exposed to radiation, this transformed him into the incredible Hulk.

Matt Murdock was bullied and lost his sight in a freak accident. His other senses got sharper, and he was later trained by a blind ninja master. He fights crime as Daredevil.

The events that give us scars also give us superpowers.

#### My Weakness Gave Me Powers

Sometimes, the process happens in this order.

I'm trying to accomplish a goal. 

I fail miserably. 

I discovered a skill that I need to learn.

I suck at the skill.

I keep going.

I feel discouraged.

I get a little better.

I make a huge mistake.

I stand up again.

I fail again.

In time, I master the skill.

Eventually, I achieve my goal.

#### We all relate to the same stories

When I read the story aloud to myself, I discover my positive traits, and I write those details down in my notebook.

When I tell the same story to the interviewer, I never have to discuss my positive traits.

The interviewer then knows my positive traits, even without me telling them.

The interviewer sometimes tells me what my positive traits for me.

When that happens, I know I passed the interview.

#### I know my positive traits, but not the story...

In some situations, you know you have specific positive traits.

Your problem is you don't have the words to communicate it.

That's okay. 

Here's what to do:

Go write a list of your positive traits.

Make a list of goals or tasks that you have you accomplished because of your positive trait.

Make a list of skills that you have acquired because of the positive trait.

Make an effort to recall the story that's connected to your positive trait.

Write down the summary of that story.

Make an effort to remember your weakness before you had a positive trait.

Write down your weakness.

Arrange the details, starting with the weakness, the journey, the skill, the goal you accomplished.

Whenever I write this, I make a list of positive traits that I have, then connect it to a story.

Sometimes, I make a list of negative traits, connect it to a story, then connect it to a positive trait that I have unlocked.

### Share a story about why you make an excellent person to hire.

Make a list of positive traits for professionals that apply to call center work.

Here are some examples:

A call center agent is expected to never get angry at the customer.

A call center agent is expected to work nights, on weekends, holidays, and is never late or absent even on shifting schedules.

A call center agent is expected to be disciplined, attentive, customer service focused.

An effective call center agent can self-study do research and never depend on just their team leader for instructions and updates.

Make a list of positive traits for call center workers.

At the top of my head, here are some examples:

If you work in customer service, you have to be patient and organized.

If you work in tech support, you have to be knowledgeable, detail-oriented.

If you work in sales, you have to be goal-oriented and persistent.

Select a positive trait that you want to highlight. 

Without directly saying what the positive trait is, write down a story that tells the listener that you have a positive characteristic. 

A story needs to have a beginning, middle, and an end. 

The story needs to end with the listener saying that you have a positive trait without directly telling them exactly what the positive characteristic is.

Here are some examples:

#### Kevin is consistently getting better.

Whenever an interviewer asks me what my greatest strength is, I have difficulty giving a consistent answer. 

Many of my current strengths are a weakness from a few months or years ago. 

I spend a lot of my free time writing down ideas in my notebook. 

I usually write down things that I learned and how to improve myself. 

I also list down failures, mistakes, and bad habits. 

When I feel positive or feel that I need to change, I solve a lot of my problems on paper. 

I come up with a plan and do the smallest thing that I can begin with immediately. 

After suffering through more painful mistakes, I begin to figure out precisely what works. Eventually, I mastered the new skill.

#### Kevin is persistent in learning to become excellent.

My boss once told me that in the beginning, he had a difficult time teaching me. 

I had a lot of questions, and I learned many of the tasks that I was assigned by doing them. 

The thing about that is, I also made a lot of embarrassing mistakes. 

My boss told me that he appreciates that I learned from my mistakes.

He appreciates that I did not give up despite being ready to quit because of my poor performance.

All my self-doubt was communicated on my face.

Little by little, I did learn from my mistakes. Eventually, I was doing all the assigned tasks smoothly and, after some time, no longer required direct supervision from my boss.

#### Avoid Unprofessional Speech

Avoid giving the following answers:

    - All of the above.
    - I'll accept any option (kahit ano)
    - Reflecting the question back to the interviewer. You decide for me.
    - Vague answers.

The best person to trust with an opportunity is someone who: 
knows what they want
communicates honestly 
and knows how to connect his personal goals to the employers' personal goals.
So they can win together.

If your goal is to only make your life better without helping the company, you are considered a parasite.

If your goal is to help the company without helping yourself, you are considered undependable.


### Give Great Instructions

Complete all step by step instructions with as many details that you can include. 

Read your answer aloud. 

Imagine someone else will read the instructions you have written.

Imagine using the instructions you have written to teach someone over the phone. 

Watch cooking shows and pay attention to how they teach the recipe.

Watch DIY, construction, and repair guides and pay attention to how they can guide you into completing a complicated task using only words.

Watch drawing tutorials and pay attention to how they give step by step instructions.

Watch programming videos.

Watch Martial Arts videos.

All these different forms of instructions have something useful to teach you.

Learn a new skill and get used to teaching what you know.

Customer service representatives teach customers how to get requests approved.

Technical support representatives teach customers how to fix their products or service.

Sales representatives teach customers how to solve their problems using the product they are selling and the best way to buy.

When you get older, your life will be easy or difficult, depending on how well you developed your teaching skills.

#### Ask yourself

Are my instructions sufficient that a grade school student will be able to complete the task after the instructions were relayed over the phone?

As always, let me know about your questions.
