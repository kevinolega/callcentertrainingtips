Chances are, this might be the main reason you paid for our lessons.

Our main goal is to get you comfortable talking during your interviews.

In this assessment, I want you to answer interview questions.

This activity has two parts.

## Part 1 - Reading the Questions

I want you to read all the questions aloud twice.

Read the questions as if you were an interviewer.

I want you to pretend that you're the interviewer, and you are asking the questions.

Now ask away.

How do you sound? Did you notice any errors?

Write down the words that you felt that sounded wrong.

We will discuss this on your first call.

## Part 2 - Answer the questions. 

**Some tips:**

Use complete sentences.

Avoid one-word answers.

Don't just say yes, no, the number, the one-word answer.

Answer in complete sentences.

One word answers kill job applications.

Even two word answers like "yes, sir!" and "no, ma'am!" get applicants eliminated.

## I'll go first...

My name is Kevin.

I live in Parañaque.

I previously worked in sales.

I want to work in a call center because I'm attracted to the high pay, benefits, and opportunities for advancement.

I also like the fact that call center work has a predictable schedule, and the reputable call center companies pay well and pay on time.

I studied at iAcademy in Makati.

I took up Business Management.

I spend my free time writing, reading books, and taking online courses.
For questions that require a short answer, stick to one to two sentences.

## Some questions require longer answers

For questions that require a longer answer, try to explain in three to five sentences.

For questions that require instructions, explanations, or stories, keep your longer answers within 10-20 sentences.

**Remember: This is version 0.01 of your interview answers. By the end of our lessons, you will have version 0.47.**

Your answers will get better over time as you learn more of the lessons.

## More Tips...

**Write as you speak**.

If you are more comfortable talking instead of writing, do this:

- Use the voice recorder or video recorder on your phone
- Begin answering the questions. 
- Listen to your recording and write down your answer in your notebook. 
- Make corrections to anything that doesn't sound correct.
- Repeat the process.

You're free to give longer answers to questions that require an explanation.

If you have a lot of free time, try to give a longer answer and a shorter answer.

During our lessons, you are allowed to make corrections to your answer.

If you find an error, cross it out and write down your new answer.

If you figure out a better answer, write that down.

If you have ten ideas on how to answer the question, write all those answers down, and select the best one.

To become good at speaking, you also need to do a lot of writing.

Sometimes you only need to change 2-3 words.

And that's okay.

There is no shame in repeating an activity, especially if the newer answer is better than the previous attempt.

I have worked with top performers in the corporate world, professional athletes, and seven-figure income entrepreneurs.

One thing that I learned is that making tiny improvements to your activities every day is the key to success.

Remember.

This exercise is version 0.01!

I'm excited to see your version 0.50!

God bless.
