Want to improve your life?

Read on.

This is a really short lesson.

Every time you are asked to describe your situation.

Just change the words "I am" to "I choose to be."

This is really simple but after 60 days **THIS PRACTICE WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!**

If you're making minimum wage now, I can guarantee you'll make at least 40k a month in a few years.

This practice has worked for me, and here's how it works...

## Let's start with basic positive "I am" statements.

1. I am good at English.
2. I am responsible.
3. I am skillful.
4. I am tech-savvy.
5. I am putting in a lot of effort into learning and improving myself.
6. I am disciplined.
7. I am having a great day.

If you change the "I am" into "I choose to be," it's going to mean the same thing, right?

Yes?

Of course!

## Here are the same examples.

1. I choose to be good at English.
2. I choose to be responsible.
3. I choose to be skillful.
4. I choose to be tech-savvy.
5. I choose to be putting in a lot of effort into learning and improving myself.
6. I choose to be disciplined.
7. I choose to be having a great day.

It's the same, right? 

Meaning didn't change?

Of course!

Now, why would you do that?

The magic happens when you apply this practice to negative statements.

## Here are some negative examples of "I am" statements.

1. I am not good at English.
2. I am not responsible.
3. I am not skillful.
4. I am not tech-savvy.
5. I am not putting in a lot of effort into learning and improving myself.
6. I am not disciplined.
7. I am not having a great day.

## Here's how it works when you change the "I am" to "I choose to"

1. I choose not to be good at English.
2. I choose not to be responsible.
3. I choose not to be skillful.
4. I choose not to be tech-savvy.
5. I choose to not put in a lot of effort into learning and improving myself.
6. I choose not to be disciplined.
7. I choose to not have a great day.

How does reading this make you feel?

Do you feel uncomfortable?

What is the point of this lesson?

**Everything you do.**

**Whatever your situation is.**

**You are choosing to do what you are doing.**

Your situation is not your fault.

Your attitude is not your fault.

**What you do next is your choice.**

Many people are not willing to do whatever it takes to succeed.

I have helped thousands of people get hired in a call center. 

I have people with weak education and came from low paying jobs, and they now work in a call center.

What you choose to become is what you will eventually become.

**They chose** to study.

**They chose** to invest in themselves.

**They chose** to put in the effort.

**They chose** to experience a little discomfort and learn from their mistakes.

In the end, the people who chose to **focus on the POSITIVE...** are the people who now EARN CALL CENTER MONEY... and MORE.

Thank you for reading.
