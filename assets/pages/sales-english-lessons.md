<h3>Why do you use writing exercises?</h3>
<p>We use self-paced writing exercises to improve your grammar.</p>
<p>It's easier to find and fix grammar errors in written form.</p>
<p>We'll inspect your writing, you'll read each sentence aloud, we'll fix your grammar and pronunciation.</p>
<p>I'll teach you techniques how to improve your sentences and sound more professional.</p>
<p>Please schedule 30-45 minutes to write daily.</p>

<h3>May I see samples of your sessions?</h3>
<p>Here's a link to <a href="https://callcentertrainingtips.com/video">Lesson Samples</a></p>

<h3>What happens during live online coaching?</h3>
<p>We'll discuss your answers after you submit your first set of writing exercises.</p>
<p>I will help correct your grammar and pronunciation during the live coaching session.</p>
<p>Please make yourself available for 20 minutes to an hour once a week for coaching.</p>	

<h3>Will you guarantee that I'll improve and get hired after I pay?</h3>
<p>The student needs to participate to succeed.</p>
<p>Your lessons are not limited to paying, reading, then watching videos after you enroll.
</p>
<p>You must participate in the writing exercises and phone coaching to sharpen your communication skills.</p>
<p>You need to read and follow all the instructions carefully.</p>
<p>Please give your best to complete all the written exercises and be on time during phone coaching.</p>

<h3>How many sessions do I need?</h3>
<p>The answer to this question depends on the skill level you are aiming at.</p>
<p>If you only have grammar and pronunciation issues, we can cover most problems in 4 sessions.</p>
<p>If you need additional help with confidence and professional situations, I‚Äôd recommend 6-8 weeks.</p>

<h3>Why do I need to pay if I can watch YouTube or read your lessons for free?</h3>
<p>Training doesn't magically make your problems go away.</p>
<p>You receive feedback and guidance when you pay for training.</p>
<p>Communication has several moving parts and is complicated to learn on your own.</p>
<p>Training is not like a magical ticket where you automatically add skills or guarantee jobs after you pay.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm offering a service where I provide value through lessons, guidance, feedback, and correction.</p>

<h3>Do I need to pay for the session before I start the training?</h3>
<p>Yes. You need to pay for the session to join the training.</p>

<h3>How much does the training cost?</h3>
<p>I charge ‚Ç±587 per session. I offer discounts to students who purchase multiple sessions.</p>

<h3>What are the benefits of active learning?</h3>
<p>üë®üèª‚Äçüéìüë©üèª‚Äçüéì  Active learning is the most effective method to sounding professional and confident at conversations, interviews, client meetings, customer service, sales & email.</p>
