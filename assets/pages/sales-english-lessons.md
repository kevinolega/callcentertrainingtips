<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">How many sessions do I need?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">The number of sessions you need depends on your current skill level, your target skill level, and the time and resources you can dedicate to working on your communication skills.</p>
<p style="color:black;">If you only have grammar and pronunciation issues, we can cover most problems in 4 sessions.</p>
<p style="color:black;">If you need additional help with confidence and professional situations, I‚Äôd recommend 6-8 weeks/sessions.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">Why do I need to pay if I can watch YouTube or read your lessons for free?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">While free resources like YouTube and online lessons can be helpful, paying for training offers personalized feedback and guidance.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Communication is complex, and learning it on your own can be challenging. Different situations require different levels of English skills.</p>
<p style="color:black;">For example, call center work in business-to-customer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) settings requires different skill levels, as does online freelancing.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Improving your communication skills can lead to better job opportunities and higher pay. It can also help you avoid misunderstandings and lost opportunities in both business and personal relationships.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Training is not a magic ticket that automatically grants you new skills or guarantees a job. Instead, it's a service that provides valuable lessons, guidance, feedback, and correction to help you grow and improve your communication abilities.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">Do I need to pay for the session before I start the training?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">Yes, you need to pay for the session before you can begin the training. This ensures you have access to all the resources, feedback, and guidance offered in the program.</p>
</details>

<details>

</details>


<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">What are the benefits of active learning?</summary>
