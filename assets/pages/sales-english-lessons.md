<p style="color:black;">You can do the writing exercises anytime you want. We suggest studying for 30 minutes to an hour daily if you can. But you can work on your modules when you're free.</p>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">Why do you use writing exercises?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">We use writing exercises because they help improve your grammar at your own pace.</p>
<p style="color:black;">It's easier to spot and fix grammar mistakes in writing.</p>
<p style="color:black;">We'll look at your writing, one sentence at a time. You'll read each sentence out loud, and we'll fix your grammar and pronunciation.</p>
<p style="color:black;">I'll teach you ways to make your sentences better and sound more professional.</p>
<p style="color:black;">We suggest setting aside 30-45 minutes each day for writing.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">Can I see samples of your sessions?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">Sure! Here's a <a href="https://callcentertrainingtips.com/video">link to sample sessions in video format</a>.</p>
</details>

<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">What happens during live online coaching?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">During live online coaching, we'll discuss your answers after you submit your first set of writing exercises.</p>
<p style="color:black;">I will help correct your grammar and pronunciation during the session.</p>
<p style="color:black;">I will also answer your questions and assign personalized practice activities to help you improve your weak areas at the end of each coaching session.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Please make yourself available for 20 minutes to an hour once a week for coaching.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">Will you guarantee that I'll improve and get hired after I pay?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">Improvement and success depend on the student's active participation.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Your lessons involve more than just paying, reading, and watching videos after you enroll.</p>
<p style="color:black;">To sharpen your communication skills, you must participate in the writing exercises and phone coaching.</p>
<p style="color:black;">It's essential to read and follow all the instructions carefully.</p>
<p style="color:black;">For maximum results, I recommend giving your best effort to complete all the written exercises and being punctual for phone coaching sessions.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">How many sessions do I need?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">The number of sessions you need depends on your current skill level, your target skill level, and the time and resources you can dedicate to working on your communication skills.</p>
<p style="color:black;">If you only have grammar and pronunciation issues, we can cover most problems in 4 sessions.</p>
<p style="color:black;">If you need additional help with confidence and professional situations, I‚Äôd recommend 6-8 weeks.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">Why do I need to pay if I can watch YouTube or read your lessons for free?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">While free resources like YouTube and online lessons can be helpful, paying for training offers personalized feedback and guidance.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Communication is complex, and learning it on your own can be challenging. Different situations require different levels of English skills.</p>
<p style="color:black;">For example, call center work in business-to-customer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) settings requires different skill levels, as does online freelancing.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Improving your communication skills can lead to better job opportunities and higher pay. It can also help you avoid misunderstandings and lost opportunities in both business and personal relationships.</p>
<p style="color:black;">Training is not a magic ticket that automatically grants you new skills or guarantees a job. Instead, it's a service that provides valuable lessons, guidance, feedback, and correction to help you grow and improve your communication abilities.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">Do I need to pay for the session before I start the training?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">Yes, you need to pay for the session before you can begin the training. This ensures you have access to all the resources, feedback, and guidance offered in the program.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">How much does the training cost?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">The cost of training starts at ‚Ç±697 for a single session. We offer discounts for multiple sessions, allowing you to save more when you commit to more weeks of training.</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary style="color:#61c17d; font-family:Lato; font-size:23px; line-height:22px;">What are the benefits of active learning?</summary>
<p style="color:black;">üë®üèª‚Äçüéìüë©üèª‚Äçüéì Active learning helps you develop professional and confident communication skills for conversations, interviews, client meetings, customer service, sales, and email. It encourages you to participate, engage, and apply the lessons, which leads to better understanding, retention, and application of the skills you learn.</p>
