- Shorten Sentences.
- Your sentences need to be complete. No Shortcuts.
- Remove the word "that," "those," "it" and be specific.
- Do not start sentences with "and," "then," "because," and other connecting words.
- Please make sure that your sentences are independent.
- Please check for capitalization problems.
- Please check for spelling problems and typo. 
- Please avoid using "shortcut versions" of words.
- Please look for missing Words (the, and, to).
- Break down all the long sentences but make sure that you still write complete sentences.
- Does my writing sound good as if I'm explaining to a teacher?
