## INSTRUCTIONS

Please read all the lessons and instructions carefully.

Please answer all the activities.

Please follow the one sentence paragraph format when you submit your answers. 

The one sentence paragraph format is explained in the lessons Removing Bad Habits and One Sentence Paragraph on Lesson 7.

Minimum number of sentences for most of the writing exercises is fifteen sentences.

We record a video of your phone coaching session for training purposes.

We publish some of the coaching sessions to our YouTube channel.

During the coaching session, we inspect your answers one sentence at a time.

We would like to avoid publishing our student's private information.

Please do not include personal info like your complete name, and complete address in your answers.

Your first name or nickname is fine for all of our questions.

Do not say: My name is James Kevin Olega. You may call me Kevin for short.

Say: My name is Kevin.

Do not say: I live in 123 Paper Street BF Homes Sucat Parañaque City.

Say: I live in Parañaque City.

The second example sounds more confident.

Please remember to:

1. Follow the One Sentence Paragraph Format
2. Shorten your sentences. Your sentence needs to have only one idea.
3. Write complete sentences.
4. Run your answers through a spelling and grammar check program.
5. Read your answers aloud before submitting.
6. Use simple words.

Please read Removing Bad Habits as many times as you need.

Send us an email for questions.

[READ: Improve Your Communication with Writing Exercises](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/writingexercise/)


While waiting for your phone coaching schedule, begin watching our recorded sessions with other students.

We provide a wealth of information during phone coaching.

The more questions you ask, the more answers we can give you.

Unfortunately, we don't always have the time to cover all the questions and sometimes we forget to cover something that you want to know.

We recommend that you list down all your questions so we can answer all those at the end of the question.

The good news is you receive the benefit other students receive because all the sessions are recorded.

Click the link to watch the other sessions and discover the challenges of other people and what solutions we came with together.

The more you understand about how we solve the problems together the better your problem solving skills become.

Your problem sovling skills get better as you understand how we solve different problems.

Higher level communication skills become available as a consequence of heightened problem solving skills.
