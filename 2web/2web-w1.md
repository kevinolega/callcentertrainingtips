**BONUS:**

I am willing to do more work to become better.

While waiting for your phone coaching schedule, begin watching our recorded sessions with other students.

We provide a wealth of information during phone coaching.

The more questions you ask, the more answers we can give you.

Unfortunately, we don't always have the time to cover all the questions and sometimes we forget to cover something that you want to know.

We recommend that you list down all your questions so we can answer all those at the end of the question.

The good news is you receive the benefit other students receive because all the sessions are recorded.

Click the link to watch the other sessions and discover the challenges of other people and what solutions we came with together.

The more you understand about how we solve the problems together the better your problem solving skills become.

Your problem sovling skills get better as you understand how we solve different problems.

Higher level communication skills become available as a consequence of heightened problem solving skills.
