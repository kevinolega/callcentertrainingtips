Training agreement expires in 90 days if you enrolled in our six weeks training.

Training agreement expires in 60 days if you enrolled in our two weeks training.

We understand that you may have encountered an issue that prevented you from continuing the lessons.

Change in management led to limiting the training agreement to 90 days.

After you enrolled, we hired staff to assist you and:

- answer your questions.
- check your answers.
- conduct the phone coaching sessions.

We still had to pay the staff whether you did the activities or not.

We did our best to extend the time.

We pushed the lessons till the end of December 2020 and went overtime during the holidays to make sure that the old students weren't left behind.

We also offered a 30 day extension period.

## Here's what you can do.

We have new modules for 2021.

**357 Two Weeks English Lessons**.

- 14 Lessons and Writing Exercises
- Two Live Coaching Sessions (Grammar and Pronunciation)

**597 Six Weeks English Lessons**.
