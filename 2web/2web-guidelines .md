Instead of giving you a failing grade, we will allow you to try again.

Please redo all the activities that you need to repeat.

## ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS

The writing exercises are designed to help you become competent at the following communication tasks:

- Telling stories.

You have to be able to articulate your goals, plans, intentions, preferences, and ideas.

## ORGANIZING YOUR ANSWERS:

We encourage our students to practice writing on paper and their notebook. 

When you submit your answers, please type your answers on your computer or smartphone.

## USE GOOGLE DOCS

Organize your writing exercises in a Google document.

Write all your questions in the Google document.

I'll answer all your questions during the phone coaching session.
