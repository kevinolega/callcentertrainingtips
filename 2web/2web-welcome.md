### What to Expect

The goal is to get you comfortable at expressing yourself in day to day conversations.

I will ask you to introduce yourself.

I will give you ideas on how to ask questions.

I will ask you to give instructions.

I will ask you to share stories.

These activities account for over 93% of day to day communication.

The first week will be easy and I’ll ask you to write 15 sentences per activity.

In the second week, I’ll ask you to write 20 sentences per activity.

At the end of the lessons, you’ll write over 300 sentences.

For pronunciation, our focus will be the use of the top 100 most used words in the English Language.

These words will be used in over 50% of all the sentences that you will be writing or speaking.

## SUBMITTING YOUR ANSWERS

I recommend that you submit your answers using Google Docs.

I'll be able to give better feedback on Google Docs because it has a comments and suggestion feature.

Please share your answers to callcentertrainingtips@gmail.com

If you have a Gmail account, you already have Google Docs. Just head over to [https://drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com) and create a new document.

If you're using a mobile device, Google Docs is available on both [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-docs-sync-edit-share/id842842640) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.docs&hl=en&gl=US).
