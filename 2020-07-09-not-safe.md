90% of new call center agents get eliminated in the first two months of getting hired.

Out of 30 trainees, there were only three of us who survived the first year in our batch.

The biggest mistake most people make is they believe that if they pass the interview, they are already secured. 

You need to pass the training.

You need to pass your trainer's evaluation.

You need to pass your team leader's evaluation.

You need to pass your client's evaluation.

You need to pass your customer's evaluation.

The customer's evaluation happens more than fifty times a day for the rest of your call center career.

If your English is still weak, every day working in a call center will become a living hell.

You will be speaking to 60-100 upset American customers eight hours a day.

Five days a week.

If your English sounds terrible, the customer will begin screaming at you.

Your team leader will be upset with you.

The management will want to get rid of you.

Your friends will invite you to resign.

Then you're jobless again.

You go back to that loser state again.

The level of communication skills to get hired in a call center is low compared to the standard needed to stay employed.

Bad English translates to horrible stats.

Horrible stats translate to getting fired sooner or later.

Even if you get hired, continue practicing your English.

If you don't prepare, you won't survive.
