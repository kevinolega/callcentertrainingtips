Hi there!

I need your support.

I started a YouTube channel.

I'm making videos on how to get hired in a call center and build the professional skills to increase your income.

I'm now sharing English lessons and advice on improving your communiction skills.

Here's a sample.

[Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/fezqHqAwKqY).

There are a bunch of posers sharing fake call center tips on YouTube who has a lot of followers.

I want to reach people with real lessons that will help improve their life.

I'll need your help to reach them.

Thanks in advance.

I'm working hard to make more free lessons available.

I'll do my best to answer your questions in the next video.
