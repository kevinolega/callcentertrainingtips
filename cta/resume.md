## BEST RESUME FORMAT FOR CALL CENTER JOB APPLICATION

Follow this formatting guide when writing your resume for a call center application.

### USE GOOGLE DOCUMENTS FOR CALL CENTER RESUME CREATION

We don't use Microsoft Office anymore.

We use Google Documents to send a resume.

But Kevin...

I don't know how to use Google Documents.

I only know how to use Microsoft Word.

Google Documents are very similar to Microsoft Word.

Google Documents has most of the features of Microsoft word.

Google Documents are easier to use.

Google Documents are automatically saved on your Google account.

You no longer need to email your resume to yourself.

You can also download your Google Documents as a PDF file.

#### SEND YOUR CALL CENTER RESUME IN A PDF FORMAT

Here's an important detail to remember when you attach or email your resume.

Send your resume as a PDF instead of a Word Document.

The PDF format allows you to preserve the formatting of your document.

Sometimes Microsoft Word documents show up differently on other computers.

This formatting inconsistency is a problem if you get your resume printed at computer shops or print-shops.

PDF files will show up exactly the same on other computers.

How to send PDF's.

1. Click File
2. Export as/Save as
3. Select "PDF."

### CALL CENTER RESUME FILENAME

Fix your resume's file name.

Here are the top two most common resume file names that I receive.

Document 01.docx

RESUME.doc

That's a horrible idea.

90% of job applicants use these names.

So when a recruiter downloads your resume, your resume will get lost in the download folder.

Add a proper file name to your resume.

Include your name.

Include the position that you're applying for.

Include the year, so you know which version of your resume that you are looking at.

Here are some examples:

Kevin Olega Customer Service Resume 2020-01.pdf

Kevin Olega Virtual Assistant Resume 2016-06.pdf

Kevin Olega Freelance Writer Resume 2016-02.pdf

PROTIP: Keep your old resumes whenever possible so you can review your experience.

Mine your experience for stories that you can use to convince the interviewer to hire you.

### CALL CENTER RESUME SUBJECT LINE

I use a similar subject line for my resume.

Whenever I email my resume, the subject line closely matches the filename.

Here are some examples:

Kevin Olega's Customer Service Representative Resume

Kevin Olega's Corporate Sales Representative Resume

Kevin Olega's Virtual Assistant Resume

If you send an email with No Subject, your email shows up as No Subject.

If you send an email with just the word "Resume" in the subject line, the receiver will likely ignore your email.

Worse, the recruiter might judge you negatively because of your carelessness.

This looks like a message of someone who handles details poorly.

This looks like a message of a sloppy worker.

This looks like a message of a person who doesn't care.

Nobody wants to hire these kinds of people.

If you ever feel that getting a high-paying job is impossible, consider that impossible is a thousand tiny steps.

### EMAIL YOUR RESUME

Make a list of the top call center companies.

Go to the company's website.

Search for the company's recruitment email address.

Send your resume over.

### SAMPLE EMAIL - COLD

Hi,

My name is Kevin.

I'd like to apply for a customer service position.

I'm excited to contribute my skills to your team.

Please see attached.

Thanks.

Kevin

Kevin

## CALL CENTER RESUME TEMPLATES:

I'm going to share two resume templates.

The first one is a version of a resume from the time that I had no experience.

[DOWNLOAD SAMPLE CALL CENTER RESUME TEMPLATE - NO EXPERIENCE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f0VOZguT9SMzYoisVh4I8eEhJ2Y87w6l/view?usp=sharing)

This one is more recent, which includes my work experience.

[DOWNLOAD SAMPLE RESUME TEMPLATE - WITH EXPERIENCE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gr1KqfC2rSJLdMBGDUYgLRyzsbnA8GtVQgXVqrguFWQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Please feel free to build your resume using this format.

If you have questions about your resume, feel free to send us a message.

Kevin.

## USE YOUR RESUME FOR ONLINE APPLICATION.

Send out your resume to different online job openings.

Are you getting phone interviews or invitations for in-person interviews?

If you don't get calls, look at your resume.

Make sure that your resume is well written.

Check your resume for grammar and spelling errors.

Make sure that your resume has the correct contact information.

Inspect your resume.

Are you highlighting your strengths on your resume?

Are you sending your resume to enough companies?

Kevin!

I sent my resume to ten companies.

I'm waiting for a reply.

I haven't gotten any reply yet.

Here's my answer:

Ten is too little.

I usually send my resume out to 20 to 200 companies before I start getting interviews.

If I'm applying for a call center job, I just send my resume to as many companies as I possibly can.

I select my job based on my conversation with the interviewer.

### ADDITIONAL CALL CENTER RESUME TIP:

After submitting your resume, be prepared to answer your phone. 

Expect a call.

Answer all unknown numbers in the same way as if you're speaking to an interviewer.

If you miss a call, call back twice and send an SMS if you don't get an answer. 

Callback spiel:

Say:

> I'm sorry I missed your call. May I know who's this?

**Don't answer calls saying "who's this?" or worse, in Tagalog.** 

Here's how I answer:

> Hello Good Morning (or afternoon or evening). May I know who's this?

### RESUME GUIDELINES

Fix and edit your resume. 

Make sure your resume has no errors and typos.

Print your resume on good paper.

Keep your resume neat.

You need 30 copies of your resume.

Here are some tips on how to keep your resume short, relevant, and interesting.

## A SIMPLE RESUME

A resume is simply a piece of paper with your contact information, work history, education, and skills.

Make sure that your resume tells the recruitment professional what you were responsible for and in charge of.

Highlight skills and experiences that you might find useful.

Do not include your personal info like height and weight. 

You're applying for call center work and not as a promo girl.

## BUILDING YOUR RESUME

Here's my complete guide to building your call center resume.

### YOUR CALL CENTER RESUME NEEDS TO BE SHORT.

When was the last time you read a full catalog or a manual? 

That's right, never.

You are not applying for a position that requires a lot of credentials.

### WRITE A SHORT CALL CENTER RESUME

The ideal resume size is one to two pages.

If you have a few jobs under your work experience, you can compress your resume into a single-page resume.

If you don't have a lot of formal work experience, you'd like to write a two-page resume.

There are situations when your experience no longer fits a single-page resume.

That's okay.

You can expand your resume to two pages when you have a lot of experience.

When I was new to the job market, I maintained a two-page resume.

My two-page resume contains all my part-time, short-term, and freelance jobs. 

I also included my interests, skills, and seminars attended to fill my two-page resume.

When I had more experience, I used a one-page resume.

After successfully landing several jobs, I eventually went back to a two-page resume.

## HOW TO WRITE A RESUME FOR CALL CENTER APPLICATION

[Click here to read how to write a resume](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/how-to-write-a-resume-for-call-center-application/).

I want to share some tips on how to improve your resume. 

These are tips based on my research and experience as a job applicant.

I also worked in recruitment. 

Here are some guidelines when writing a resume for a call center application: 

A resume is a conversation piece. 

I want you to think of your application as a business process.

I'd like you to picture yourself in this manner:

- You are a seller
- Your services will be your product
- Your resume is your brochure/advertisement.

With that in mind, here are some things to consider when you're creating your advertisement.

### YOUR RESUME NEEDS RELEVANT INFORMATION.

Remember that the common positions are customer service, sales, and tech support? 

Act accordingly.

Add details that highlight that you have customer service, sales, and tech support skills.

### YOUR RESUME HAS TO BE INTERESTING.

Recruiters receive thousands of job applications a day.

Recruiters are looking for ways to eliminate unqualified applicants faster.

Recruiters remove unqualified applicants so to find good applicants.

Recruiters know what they are looking for, and they are aiming to find the best.

It's your job to convince the recruiter that you're a good person to hire.

You'll need to convince the recruiter that you're a good person.

Here are some tips on how to keep your resume short, relevant, and interesting.

### WRITE SPECIFIC JOB DESCRIPTIONS

Be specific about your resume's job descriptions.

Do you have awards, achievements, and accomplishments?

Recruiters like numbers.

I've sold ₱11 Million worth of Property in six months, working as a real estate agent.

I've helped the call center school sell ₱5,000,000 training services.

I'm a top agent in 2013 for Customer Service Feedback - Customer Satisfaction.

I'm a top agent in 2015 for TSR, a Sales KPI.

I'm a consistent awardee of Customer Satisfaction Incentive and have earned an extra 100k over two years.

I'm a super-agent.

I'm a level-ten customer service representative.

Recruiters spend a lot of time reviewing your work experience.

I often find missing job descriptions when I review resumes.

If you worked as a sales representative, you might not realize that: 

Different companies have different work assignments.

Different companies use different tools.

Different companies have different policies and procedures.

The job description for a sales representative will vary from job to job.

One company may have the sales representatives:

1. Go to the office.
2. Offer products to sell to walk-in clients.
3. Answer phone inquiries.

Another company may have the sales representative:

1. Research relevant industries and companies that can become clients.
2. Telemarket different businesses and offer service.
3. Building, updating, and maintaining a customer database.
3. Copywriting tasks: Writing marketing collaterals and email.
4. Email Marketing: Reaching out to clients for offers and announcements.
5. Appointment setting: Telemarketing to generate appointments for the company.
6. Scoping: Probing clients for sales requirements.
7. Presenting: Presenting technical sales information.
8. Writing Proposals to match client requirements.
8. Negotiating budgets and time-frames with clients.
9. Closing: Processing the paperwork to complete the transaction.
10. Collections: Retrieving payment from clients.
10. Account management: Consistently reaching out to clients for future orders and upgrades.
11. Networking: Attending events and parties to build relationships with existing clients and get new clients.
12. Social Media Management: Using copywriting skills and multimedia skills to maintain relationships and generate clients using social media platforms.
13. Answer phone inquiries.

Which kind of salesperson are you?

If you just put Sales Representative on your resume, I wouldn't know which one.

Perhaps you have more responsibilities or fewer responsibilities than my examples.

I wouldn't know unless you tell me.

I strongly recommend that you include these details on your resume.

What are your responsibilities and daily tasks?

This principle applies to any job.

Different jobs have different responsibilities.

You will look more responsibly and trustworthy when you have more responsibilities in your job description.

Include details of your responsibilities in your resume:

I like starting my sentences with the following words:

Responsible for... (output)

In charge of... (tasks)

What victories are you responsible for?

What tasks are you in charge of?

### USE A PROFESSIONAL EMAIL ADDRESS IN YOUR CALL CENTER JOB APPLICATION

Don't use sexyangelbutterfly@yahoo.com or ilovechocolate@hotmail.com. 

Use an email address that has your name in it. 

My email address is kevinolega@gmail.com, and I recommend that you open a similar email address if you haven't done so.

Here are more examples:

If you have a website, you can use:

hello@kevinolega.com

or

kevin@callcentertrainingtips.com

Alternate ideas.

Add services or industry.

kevinolegaservices@gmail.com

kevinolegamarketing@gmail.com

Use Initials:

kolega@gmail.com

kevino@gmail.com

Stop using Yahoo Emails.

I recommend using Gmail or iCloud if you have an Apple device.

### PLACE ACTIVE CONTACT NUMBERS ON YOUR CALL CENTER RESUME

Place active contact numbers at the top of your call center resume.

The recruiter will contact you when you qualify for a position.

The recruiter will call and/or email you to:

1. Conduct a phone interview.
2. Schedule an in-person interview.

When I was working in recruitment, if I couldn't reach an applicant on his or her mobile phone or landline, I move on to the next applicant.

Increase your message and call alert volume to the maximum whenever you are looking for work.

Never place your phone in silent mode.

Missed calls often lead to missed opportunities.

Answer calls politely and professionally.

### MAKE YOUR CALL CENTER RESUME EASY TO READ

Make your resume easy to read.

Please don't use crazy designs.

Do not use font's that are difficult to read.

Do not use comic sans or script or whatever. 

Do not use font or lettering that resembles graffiti or gangster signs.

I use Arial, Verdana, and Calibri for Windows-based computers.

I use Arial, Lato, Helvetica Neue, and Open Sans when I'm composing on Google Docs.

I use Helvetica and Lato for Mac Based computers. 

My font varies from 11-14 for body text.

I use anywhere from 16 to 24 for my header text.

I do my best to stick to one font.

I sometimes use another font to adjust the headings.

### STAY AWAY FROM RESUME WIZARD

I found it best to organize the details of my resume in a text file.

I arrange my resume using my own format.

I've tried Apple's Pages templates, and the resume looks okay.

I've tried Google Doc's templates, and I've seen many good-looking resumes.

Here's my problem with many templates.

The design is complicated.

There's a lot of sections that don't fit together.

There's a lot of lines.

I made my own template.

I follow a simple top to bottom format to present the information.

I don't use columns or lines.

I want my resume to be simple and easy to read.

### REMOVE PERSONAL INFORMATION

Personal information in a call center application is not relevant information.

Remove the following information from your resume:

- Height
- Weight
- Date of Birth
- Age
- Religion

Unnecessary details waste time, ink, paper, time, and attention. 

Call center recruiters are after what you can do for them.

Call centers don't care about your vital statistics.

**NO NEED TO INCLUDE EVERYTHING**.

A resume must be relevant.

If you've had several jobs, don't include jobs from several years ago.

Often, the last three or four jobs will do.

However, you might need a more comprehensive resume if you jumped to different jobs several times.

### ADDITIONAL RESUME FILLERS THAT YOU CAN REMOVE AND REASONS WHY:

**AGE**  

Not unless you're below 18 or over 60. 

If you're younger than 18 and older than 60, you are automatically disqualified. 

**DATE OF BIRTH** 

Not unless you were hoping your recruiter bases your personality on your zodiac sign. 

I used to work for an employer who did this.

He wanted to avoid hiring someone who was born on the year of the sheep.

**HEIGHT**

Call center companies don't care how tall or short you are. 

I understand that this is important if you're working as a model, saleslady, or security guard.

**WEIGHT** 

Your weight doesn't matter to call center employers.

It's all good.

Put in your weight if you are heavy enough to wreck office chairs by sitting on them.

**RACE** 

Call center companies are equal opportunity employers. 

Many call centers, clients, and customers don't care about race.

**EYE COLOR** 

You are not applying as a commercial model.

We don't care if that's your real eye color or you're wearing a contact lens. 

**NATIONALITY**

Call center companies are equal opportunity providers, but you can ask. 

As far as I know, Filipinos are okay.

Foreign applicants may require a working visa/permit. 

**RELIGION** 

Call center companies are good with any religion.

Call center companies are good with no religion.

The only possible discussion about religion is if you have any religious activities that conflict with your work and sleep schedule.

**SEX** 

Call center jobs accept males, females, or anything in between. 

Sex doesn't matter in a resume.

**SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER**

Remove your social security number from your resume.

Your social security number should be confidential. 

**TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBER**: 

Your TIN Number is not relevant to your job application. 

Remove your TIN Number from your resume.

**PAGIBIG NUMBER**

Your PAGIBIG Number is not relevant to your application. 

Remove your PAGIBIG Number from your resume.

**HEALTH INSURANCE NUMBER**

Your Health Insurance Number is not relevant to your application. 

Remove your Health Insurance Number from your application.

**PASSPORT NUMBER**

Your passport number is not relevant to your Call Center Job application.

Call center jobs do not require a passport.

Do not put your passport number on your resume.

Not unless you want to brag that you have a passport. 

**I HEREBY DECLARE THAT ALL THE INFORMATION IS TRUE AND CORRECT**. 

Everything you put on your resume is already true and correct. 

There is no need to reiterate the statement by adding this line to your resume.

Your resume is a summary that includes your contact information and limited documentation of your work history, education, and skills.

**SIGNATURE**

Your resume is a resume, not a contract.

You do not need to sign your resume.

### SHOULD I ADD A PICTURE TO MY CALL CENTER RESUME?

To add a picture or not to add a picture?

Using a picture in a resume may bring up conversations about discrimination and racism in American culture. 

The situation is different in the Philippines.

I tried going with the no-picture approach.

In my experience, the security guards and receptionists always ask for a picture anyway.

Sticking an ID photo to my resume is expensive, annoying, and a hassle.

I later decided just to add a picture to my resume's file.

My photo gets included whenever I print my resume.

After a dozen job applications or so, I realized the reason why it makes sense to keep your photo on your resume.

Having a picture in your resume helps the guard, receptionist, or recruitment professional identify you when they call your name in the reception area.
 
If you look good, then adding a picture is an advantage.

If you're not very good-looking, include your photo anyway and carry out your application with your confidence. :)

### LOOK FOR TYPOS ON YOUR CALL CENTER RESUME

Nothing ruins a well-written resume like a typo. 

What's worse is if the typo happens to be on your phone number. 

Hurry up and go check.

Copy-paste your resume to an online spelling and grammar checker tool like Grammarly.

Look for typos.

Go over your resume more than twenty times to make sure that everything is correct.

### ASK FOR HELP TO FIND FOR TYPOS ON YOUR CALL CENTER RESUME

Ask someone else to help you look for typos on your call center resume.

It's sometimes difficult to spot all the typos by yourself.

I often ask someone else to double-check.

I ask my friends and family members with good English skills to help check my resume for errors.



## HOW TO BUILD A CALL CENTER RESUME FROM SCRATCH NO WORK EXPERIENCE

[Click here to read lesson](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/how-to-build-a-call-center-resume-from-scratch-no-work-experience/).

Since I get a lot of questions on how to build a resume from scratch, I created a [sample resume that you can use for your call center application <](https://www.evernote.com/l/AI5b2_jFRg5BYbHXWJkLvs5STS9EjsNbh2o).

I also added comments to each part, so be sure to read my notes.

Here are a few rules I applied to write my Call Center resume.

### RESUME WRITING RULES

The font is Arial.

The font size for my name is 24.

The font size for the title text is 16.

The font size for everything else is 11.

I keep the resume minimal.

I do my best to eliminate unnecessary details.

### ONE PAGE OR TWO PAGE RESUME

A one-page resume is ideal.

I do my best to stick to a one-resume format.

I realized that a one-page resume only applies if you have some decent work experience.

A one-page resume only works if you don't have a job-hopping history or long periods of unemployment in your recent history.

I also realized that I preferred a single-page resume because one resume costs less to print.

When I was starting out, I used a two-page resume.

### REMOVE THE OBJECTIVE

I didn't include an objective because it's obvious that you are looking for a job.

I also didn't include a summary because I don't have a lot of things to put in my resume.

I don't need to summarize that my application is for a call center agent position.

### IMPORTANT DETAILS IN A CALL CENTER RESUME

Here are some of the details I included. 

Do your best to stick to one page. 

Feel free to NOT include any of the optional details.

Many of the optional details are just used as fillers.

1.  Full Name
2.  Mobile Number
3.  Landline (if any)
4.  Email Address - Please use a professional email address.
5.  Physical Address or Home Address.
6.  Work Experience. If any - Summer jobs and part-time jobs also apply. You may also include Freelance and Volunteer work.
7.  Education - College only, but if you need fillers, feel free to add high school.
8. Training and Seminars
9.  Extra-Curricular Activities
10.  Skills and Interests - I normally don't include this these days, but if you need a filler, this works too.
11.  Software - Include work-related software like MS, Apple or Google Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations. Photoshop. WordPress or other tools will be useful.
12.  Reference - I don't include this, but if you need a filler, this works just fine.

#### Elements I add to the resume to increase the length.

I'd like to stick to the one-page resume rule, but my resume should not be less than 3/4th of the page, so I include the following fillers.

1.  Software
2. Training and Seminars attended
3.  Reference

So there you have it. 

I hope this short guide helps you get hired in a call center. 

Let me know how resume writing is working out for you.

## USING YOUR CALL CENTER RESUME FOR WALK-IN APPLICATIONS

Walk-in applications are inevitable.

When you're trying to get a job in a call center, you'll eventually find yourself in a call center office.

You'll tell the receptionist that you're a job applicant.

You may tell the receptionist that you have an appointment if a recruiter invited you over.

You'll hand your resume to a recruitment professional.

You'll use your resume as a guide for your interview.

Here are my tips on how to maximize your use of your resume for call center walk-in applications.

### PRINT YOUR RESUME USING GOOD QUALITY PAPER AND INK

You want to project a professional image.

Do not ruin your professional image by going cheap on paper. 

It's okay to go to a computer shop that charges you 3-5 pesos per page.

Use the printing service if the print output and paper quality are good. 

If the quality isn't good, I buy my own paper.

If bringing my own paper doesn't improve the print quality, I look for another computer shop.

### PRINT MULTIPLE COPIES OF YOUR RESUME

I've literally had dozens of interviews because someone random person asked for my resume.

On my way to a job application or home after an interview, I see an aunt or uncle who finds out I'm looking for work, asks for a copy of my resume because they are on their way to meet a friend who is hiring for a position in their company.

There were opportunities in the past when the job is drool-worthy, and I didn't have a resume, and they hired someone else the same day.

Having spare copies of your resume enable you to tell yourself that: 

If this interview doesn't go well, I'm going to submit my application to another company. 

Walk-in applications to the nearby call centers are my plan B. 

This interview will just be practice for my job offer.

### PRINT THIRTY COPIES OF YOUR RESUME.

When you apply for work, some companies will say yes, and some companies will say no. 

It's okay. 

Take the no's and use what you learned from the experience to prepare yourself for the yes.

The job application process is a process.

You will win some and lose some.

Winning and losing are part of the game.

Have several copies of your resume to remind yourself that it takes several attempts to land a job.

An interview is like a first date.

That said, you don't want to marry your first date.

You have to go look for a match.

If it is not a good match, you need to go on another date.

You keep going on dates until you find someone you like.

You also have to get to several dates before you find your regular date and the one you'll eventually pair up with.

On a lighter note, you have no right to complain until after you have used up all thirty copies of your resume.

## MAXIMIZE YOUR WALK-IN APPLICATION BY BRINGING MULTIPLE COPIES OF YOUR RESUME.

We don't always succeed on our first try.

Luckily, the more attempts we make, the higher our chances of finding work.

Call center companies follow a one-day hiring process.

You'll know if you passed or failed within the same day.

If you went to a call center in the morning and failed at lunchtime, you can go to another center on the same day.

Move on to the next one immediately after.


### PROTECT YOUR CALL CENTER RESUME

Do not commute from your house to a call center office with only a single copy of your resume in your hand.

Protect your resume.

Bring a nice hard folder to your call center interview.
 
Resume's no matter how well written, will give off a bad impression about you when crumpled. 

Avoid folds by bringing a nice hard folder or envelope.

### USE A HARD ENVELOP

A crumpled resume means you're irresponsible. 

Naah, I just made that up. 

Seriously.

The last thing that you want to give an interviewer is a crumpled resume.

How you do anything reflects how you do everything.

Give your interviewer a crisp, good-quality resume.

Show the interviewer that you are a reliable professional.

You can prepare well and print a good resume.

However, if you travel to the city and ride public transportation, your resume will get crumpled in your bag.

### COST OF PRINTING CALL CENTER RESUMES

Print 30 copies when you are 100% satisfied with your resume.

Make sure you have no grammar errors, so you don't need to re-print your resume.

Resume Printing is often ₱5 per page at 30 copies ₱150.

If you're using a two-page resume, you'll end up spending ₱300.

There were several times that I was short on budget.

I ended up making two kinds of resumes.

I have a single-page resume for most of my job applications.

I used my two-page resume for my final interviews.

I just hand the HR head or the boss my two-page resume after I pass the initial interview.

I'll have thirty single-page resumes.

I'll have ten two-page resumes.

₱5x30=₱150
₱10x10=₱100

The total cost is ₱250.

When you're broke, the extra ₱50 goes a long way.

That's why you need to use hard envelopes to protect your resume.

### USING CALL CENTER RESUME FOR WALK-IN APPLICATIONS 

We are engaging the whole building.

I'm embarrassed to admit that I don't recall her name.

I think it was Ice or something.

I don't think that's her real name.

That might be her hip-hop name, street name, or chat name.

Let's just call her Ice.

I met Ice at a drinking session.

I told her that I wanted to work in a call center and earn ₱20,000 a month.

She said that she's looking for work.

We agreed to meet up to look for a job together.

She brought her other friend who was also looking for work.

The Ice girl was smart.

I only knew three companies.

[We failed at Convergys together](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/convergys-fail/).

We failed at ICT.

We failed at Teleperformance.

People Support required college graduates back then.

Whenever we entered a building, Ice asked the guard if there are other call center companies in the building.

If the guard said yes, Ice would ask for the company name and what floors the companies are in.

What floors do the job applicants go to? 

Ice asked the guard.

Ice tells the guard that she needs a job soon or her parents are kicking her out.

She asks the guard for help.

She tells that guard that we're just submitting applications.

We went to one building and ended up visiting seven companies.

I ran out of resumes then.

I only brought three.

Ice had about twenty resumes with her.

We ended up submitting our resume to seven companies then.

I obviously submitted mine to three.

I looked awkward and told the receptionist at companies four, five, six, and seven that I ran out of resumes.

Company six's HR Head greeted us at the desk and processed Ice's job application on the spot.

Company seven's business owner was in the office and had nothing to do, so he interviewed Ice himself.

After waiting for an hour, Ice told her other companion and me that she got hired and is starting next week.

I need to get more resumes printed out.

I'll come back to these companies.

I told myself.

I never did.

I should have brought more resumes.


## Fix Your References and Social Media Profile

Let your reference know that you're applying so they can answer their phones and know that HR staff will be calling to ask about you.

[Read this guide and update your Facebook Page](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/fb-profile/).

## WHAT DO RECRUITERS SEE WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOUR CALL CENTER RESUME?

Do you have an email address?

Does your email address look professional?

Do you have any grammar, spelling, and punctuation mistakes?

Is your resume well written?

When I look for work, after I finalize my resume, I print thirty copies.

That way, I know that I have no right to complain until after I use up each resume in an interview.

Anyway, here's a summary:

The first five applications suck.

I usually say something stupid, or I just fail the interview.

It's okay.

That's just practice.

The next five applications are bad companies: 

I pass the screening, but this time they don't pass my screening.

The pay is too low.

The work conditions are bad.

The boss wants suicide bombers, not employees or something like that.

I walk away from these job offers.

The final five are acceptable.

They like me, and I seem to like them.

At this point, I pick the best.

You don't want to just pick the first good offer. 

You need to compare, so you have a good deal.

Don't compare it with too many, though. 

Five is good.

The final one, company number sixteen, is where I'll work.

**ALWAYS REMEMBER**:

Apply, make an offer, get a deal, or walk away.

Repeat sixteen times.


## WRITE RESUME STORIES

Tell me something about yourself that's not in your resume.

Many people misunderstand this question.

Applicants begin to talk about their high-school days.

The topic goes to personal preferences, life, struggles, and hobbies.

That's not what the interviewer means.

The interviewer is asking you for the story behind the details of your resume.

I spent more time looking for work than many of my friends because of my educational background.

I got more rejections in my belt.

I have more disappointing bus rides home than any of my old batchmates.

I've spent the majority of my thinking about how I can sell myself better at job interviews.

I realized that I need to articulate stories about my past work.

What do I talk about during interviews?

Companies hire employees to solve problems.

You need to put together examples of situations where you solved problems for companies.

You need examples of situations where you did a good job.

It would sound pretentious if all your stories are positive.

You also need stories about failures and what you learned from your failures.

You also want to include stories where you had to fight hard to win.

You need stories where you talk about your experience.

Interviewers will ask the following questions sooner or later:

Tell me about your previous job.

Why did you leave your previous job?

What did you like about your previous job?

What didn't you like about your previous job?

What did you like about your previous boss?

What didn't you like about your previous boss?

What are you looking for in your next job?

What situation would you like to avoid in your next job?

I'll need to prepare my stories for these questions.

I can't answer these questions carelessly.

I can't blindly say:

I'm looking for greener pastures, or I hated my boss's guts, or the job is too hard.

Those answers come back to haunt you in the form of:

What would you do if we hired you and someone offered you a job that paid more after a few weeks?

What would you do if we hired you and discovered that your boss's personality strongly conflicts with your personality?

What would you do if we hired you then you discovered that the work is harder than you expected?

What would you do if we hired you, then you discovered that the tasks required for the job are painful to learn? 

Will you continue suffering and cause inconvenience to others, or will you voluntarily resign?

### Look At Your Resume And Review Each Section.

Go through each job.

Go through each school.

Ask yourself the following:

Tell a story about what's awesome about (specific work experience).

Tell a story about what sucks about (same specific work experience)

What have you learned from (specific work experience)

What did you learn from (specific work experience) that would greatly contribute to your job now?
 
Apply this exercise to each section, including the details.

Look at your home address, your school, from elementary to high school to college, the people in your reference.

What's the story of where you live?

Tell me a few stories about all the schools that you've been to.

Tell me a few stories about the people you met growing up.

What valuable skills did you learn?

What attitude did you pick up?

Practice telling these stories.

** WHAT'S THE POINT?**

I want to come up with excellent answers to call center interviews.

I want to be unforgettable.

I want the kind of answers that keep your interviewer focused on you and wanting more.

This writing exercise is my way of going the extra mile.

The people who go the extra mile get ahead.

The people who do the minimum are stuck at minimum wage.

Let's imagine this situation.

You look at the internet.

You Google: Call Center Interview Best Answers.

You copy the best answers.

Guess what.

Thousands of people copied the same answers.

Your interviewer has already heard whatever answer you copied from the internet.

You put in a lot of effort.

You memorize the answers.

You practice your answers.

Something's off with your answers.

You sound like a fake.

The interviewer gives you several follow-up questions.

You fail to answer the follow-up questions.

You now sound like a liar.

The interviewer responds to your lie with another lie.

"We'll just call you if you're ever shortlisted for the position."

I know this because I did this.

Answers copied from the internet don't work.

I grew up in a Catholic family.

My grandmother and, eventually, several family members started attending a Christian Church.

I also grew up watching anime.

As a consequence, I can't lie.

When I try to lie, my lie becomes obvious.

Copying internet answers don't work for me.

You should hire me because I'm a born problem-solver – I love the intellectual challenge of figuring out how to fix issues. Part of this is being able to calmly communicate with clients to gather information about problems. Successfully resolving trouble tickets makes me as happy as when I've finished a Sudoku puzzle in record time.

This answer isn't true.

This answer is partly true.

I do like solving problems but copying these words won't work because this isn't my answer.

I never even played Sudoku.

What happened since I started writing my own answers?

I'm confident my answers are pretty awesome, but you know what?

So are your answers.

You can't read my blog, book, or lessons and copy my stories.

You can't tell my stories because my stories are not your life experiences.

Your stories are even more awesome.

In fact, I would like to hear your stories.

Seriously.

I enjoy reading every story I get in the email, the comments section of my website, and Facebook page.

#### HERE ARE ADDITIONAL TIPS:

Tell the stories again and again, and check yourself for grammar and pronunciation errors.

Write your story down.

Read your story aloud.

Record yourself reading your story.

Listen to yourself.

Does your story need to be longer or shorter?

Nevermind.

Write a long version of your story (100 sentences).

Write a short version of your stories (5-20 sentences)

Will the story catch the interviewer's attention?

Does this story say that I'm a good person to hire?

Does this story say that I'm a good person?

What other stories can I share?

I have now passed on to you one of my most valuable techniques.

So go ahead and practice writing stories from your resume and life experience.

Use this technique well.

You don't need to memorize the stories.

You just need to write the stories in your notebook.

You want to know yours in advance.

You want an English version of your stories.

Having your stories ready will allow you to share your stories whenever the situation calls for it.

Stories are proof.

Stories are the closest things to prove that you are a great catch.

Share your stories with me as well.

Send me an email.

Introduce yourself.

Tell me a story.

I look forward to reading your amazing stories.

You can't tell my stories because they are not your life experiences.

If you're having difficulty writing stories, I'm selling a training program where the main focus is I help my students write stories that help them qualify for higher-paying jobs.
