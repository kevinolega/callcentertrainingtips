Fix and edit your resume. Make sure it has no erros and typos.

Print your resume on good paper and keep it neat.

You need 30 copies.


A resume is a conversation piece.

If you think of the application process as a business process, I’d like you to picture yourself in this manner:

You are a seller
Your services will be your product
Your resume is your brochure/advertisement With that in mind, here are some things to consider when you’re creating your ad.
It has to be short - When was the last time you read a full catalog or a manual? That’s right, never.

You are not applying for a position that requires a lot of credentials.


 
It has to be relevant - Remember that the common positions are customer service, sales and tech support? Act accordingly.

It has to be interesting - While recruiters are looking for ways to sift out (in other words eliminate) unqualified applicants, they are also looking for ways to hire good ones.

They have an idea of what they are looking for so all you have to do is show them that you are.

Here are some tips on how to keep your resume short, relevant and interesting.

Look For Typos
Nothing ruins a well written resume like a typo.

What’s worse is if the typo happens to be on your phone number.

Hurry up and go check.


What Do Recruiters See When They Look At Your Resume?
Do you have an email address?

Does your email address look professional?

Do you have any grammar, spelling and punctuation mistakes?

Is your resume well written?

When I look for work, after I finalize my resume, I print twenty copies.

That way I know that I have no right to complain until after I use up each one in an interview.

Anyway here’s a summary:

First five applications suck.

I usually say something stupid or I just fail the interview.

So it’s okay.

That’s just practice.

Next five applications are bad companies: So I pass but this time they don’t pass.

The pay is too low.

The work conditions are bad.

The boss wants suicide bombers , not employees or something like that.

I walk away from these job offers.

The final five are acceptable.

They like me and I seem to like them.

At this point, I pick the best.

You don’t want to just pick the first good offer, you need to compare so you have a good deal.

Don’t compare it with too many though. Five is good.

The final one, company number sixteen is where I’ll work.

Always remember:

Apply, make an offer, get a deal or walk away.

Repeat about sixteen times.

Google Documents
We don’t use Microsoft Office anymore.

We use Google Documents to send a resume.

Google it.

Send PDF’s
When you attach or email your resume.

You should send it as a PDF instead of a word document.


4. Multiple Copies Of Your Resume
I’ve literally have dozens of interviews because someone random asked for my resume.

On my way to a job application or home after an interview, I see an aunt or uncle who finds out I’m looking for work, asks for a copy of my resume because they are on their way to meet a friend who is hiring for a position in their company.


 
There were opportunities in the past when the job is drool-worthy and I didn’t have a resume and they hired someone else the same day.

Having spare copies of your resume enable you to tell yourself that if this interview doesn’t go well, I’m going to do a walk-in application to the nearby call center and this interview will just be practice for that.

Resume Printing is Php 5 per page at 30 copies Php 150.


1. Print Thirty Copies Of Your Resume.
The application process is a process.

You will win some and lose some.

That’s part of it.

Have several copies of your resume to remind yourself that it takes several attempts to land a job.

An interview is like a first date.

That said you don’t want to marry your first date.

You have to go look for a match.

If it is not a good match, you need to go on another date.

You keep going on dates until you find someone you like.


 
You also have to get to several dates before you find your regular date and the one you’ll eventually pair up with.

On a lighter note, you have no right to complain until after you have used up all thirty copies of your resume.

Look At Your Resume And For Each Section.
Tell a story about what’s awesome about (specific work experience)

Tell a story about what sucks about (same specific work experience)

What have you learned from (specific work experience)

What did you learn from (specific work experience) that would greatly contribute to you your job now?


 
Apply this exercise to each section including the details.

Your home address, your school, from elementary to high school to college, the people in your reference.

Practice telling these stories.

What’s The Point?
Ever want to come up with awesome answers to call center interviews?

The kind of answers that keep your interviewer focused on you and wanting more?

If you look at the Internet and copy the answers from others then there is a good chance that your interviewer had heard of that from somewhere before and it makes you a copying fake.

I’m confident my answers are pretty awesome but you know what?

So are your answers.

You can’t tell my stories because they are not your life experiences.

Your stories are even more awesome.

In fact, I would like to hear them.

Seriously.

I enjoy reading every story I get in the email, the comments and in the Facebook page of the website.

Here Are Additional Tips
Tell the stories again and again and check yourself for grammar and pronunciation errors.

Write it down.

Read it.

Record it.

Listen to yourself.

Does it need to be longer or shorter?

Will it catch their attention?

Does this story say that I’m a good catch?

What other stories can I share?

I have now passed on one of my important techniques.

So go ahead and practice it and use it well.

You don’t need to memorize the stories.

You just need to know them in advance so you are ready to use them whenever the situation calls for it.

Stories are proof.

Stories are the closest things to prove that you are a great catch.

Share your stories here with me as well.

I look forward to reading your amazing stories.

Maximize Your Walk-In Application By Bringing Multiple Copies Of Your Resume.
We don’t always make it on our first try.

Luckily, the more attempts we make, the higher our chances of finding work.

I recently talked about how Call Center Companies mostly practice One Day Process when it comes to their screening process, so with that in mind, you can find out immediately if you passed or not.

Move on to the next one immediately after.

Bring A Nice Hard Folder To Your Call Center Interview.

 
Resume’s no matter how well written will give off a bad impression about you when crumpled. Avoid folds by bringing a nice hard folder or envelope.


A Simple Resume
A resume is simply a piece of paper with your contact information, work history and skills.

Make sure it tells them what you were responsible for and in charge of.

Highlight skills and experiences that you might find useful.

Do not include your personal info like height and weight, you’re applying for call center work and not as a promo girl.

1. Online application.

You send out your resume.

Are you getting phone interviews or invitations for in-person interviews?

If you don’t get calls, look at your resume.

Make sure that it is well written, with no grammar and spelling errors, you have the correct contact information, you are highlighting your strengths and you are sending it to enough companies.

Ten is too little.

I usually send my resume out to 20 to 200 companies before I start getting interviews.

If it’s a call center job I just send it to everyone and I select from everyone who’s interested.


The Ice girl was smart, she only knew three companies so whenever we entered a building, she asked the guard if there are other call center companies in the building and what floor their hiring office is in because we’re submitting applications.

I ran out of resumes then.

I only brought three.

She had about twenty with her.

We ended up submitting our resume to four companies then.

I, obviously submitted mine to three.

I need to get more printed out.
