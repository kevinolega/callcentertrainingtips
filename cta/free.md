Thank you for visiting this website.

My name is Kevin, and I'm the writer and website admin.

I have been helping friends get hired in a call center since 2005 and stared posting lessons at this website in 2011.

I use my personal time to write and figure out solutions to my own problems.

I then discovered that I can share what I learned to my friends using my writing and my websites.

This website has over 400 free lessons.

Feel free to explore.
