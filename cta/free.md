Thank you for visiting this website.

![Kevin webmaster]({{ site.url }}/images/2019-07-Kevin-Gray.jpg =300).


My name is Kevin and I'm the writer and website admin.

I have been helping friends get hired in a call center since 2005 and stared this website in 2011.

I use my personal time to write and figure out solutions to my own problems.

I then discovered that I can share what I learned to my friends using my writing and my websites.

This website has over 400 free lessons.

Feel free to explore.

When you get the chance, please enroll in our coaching to learn new skills and support our website.

It only costs Php 250.
