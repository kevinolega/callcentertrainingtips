Please select a schedule from the calendar.

Write your questions on Google Docs. 

Transfer your answers to Google Docs if you submitted your answers using PDF of MS Word.

Confirm your phone number and mobile network. 

Adding your phone number and network helps us know which phone to use to call you.

Confirm your email address.

Include how many sessions we've had and remind me of your goals for the session.

NOTE: I check the schedule the night before or first thing in the morning. 

Please avoid scheduling the same day.

Same day schedules are not guaranteed.

For example: If it's 11 am or 1 pm and you see an open schedule for 5pm the same day, we may reschedule you at a different day.

I'll send you an email if we need to reschedule.
