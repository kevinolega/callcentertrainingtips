## Special Lessons

This page is part of my community service.

So I give lessons on FB, the website (main), YouTube (new) and send activities via email for free.

I also offer coaching for Php 250.

When you avail the 250, you get an extra set of training materials and three phone sessions with me.

My focus is interview preparation for call center work. 

We'll be correcting your mistakes and I'll guide you until you get hired. 

This is my community service so I'm only charging a small amount because it helps cover the expenses of maintaining my website and production cost of training materials and the salary of my team.

And you are under no obligation to buy if you're not interested.

I'm just informing you that the option to pay and get extra time and dedicated help from me is available.

I'm still going to send you free lessons.

I'm still going to answer emails and chat questions when I'm logged in.

And I'm still going to post lessons on the website and the page.

[Click here if you still want to go after your dreams solo](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/team).

If you want to avail the coaching, payment is by bank deposit and sessions are done on the phone so I'll need your number. Globe and landline is good. Or Skype if you have fast internet.

GUARANTEE:

We will become a real team and I will teach you my secrets on how to pass interviews and you can get that sweet sweet call center money.

The questions is are you only interested in making 30,000/month or are you committed to becoming the best version of yourself and earning what you are worth?
