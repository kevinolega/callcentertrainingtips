## Call Center Training Tips Testimonials

> "I am a shy person, the first time I went for an interview, I feel like someone is choking me. On the second day, I went to three call center companies, on the third day, I got a job offer. You are correct, the more companies I went to, the more I learned from my mistakes, and the more confident, I became. The best thing about applying in the call center is that the recruitment staff is honest with me about my performance on the interview. I got a no or a yes and didn't have to wait days or weeks to find out. Thank you for all the training tips. More Power!" - Jomel D.
