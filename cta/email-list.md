I share my best lessons on my email list.

The sequence of learning the lessons is just as important as the lessons that you are learning.

When you sign up, you'll receive the lessons in the exact order that I intended for you to receive.

I've written over 250 lessons on how to get hired in a call center and build your professional skills to grow your income.

I'm also going to share opportunities that I don't post publicly on social media.

I look forward to staying in touch with you via email.

When you receive my email, please send a reply to introduce yourself.

One reason I do all of this is I enjoy meeting new people.
