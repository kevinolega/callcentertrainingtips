ATTENTION: In the letter below, you're going to learn a handful of "conversation secrets" that can turn you into a "smooth" and confident applicant almost overnight (even if you're usually shy or boring)...

## "Amazing 'Conversation Secrets' You Can Use Right Now to Have More Fun, Engaging, Interview Conversations with Recruiters...Without Ever Having to Worry About What to Say Next, Your Mind Going Blank, or Awkwardly Stalling Out..."

**If You're Ready To Finally Discover How to Smoothly Take Your Interview Conversations to the Next Level and Get The Interviewer to Love You... Creating Confidence, Rapport and Belief in Your Abilities... Then This Will Be The Most Important Letter You Will Ever Read**...

**Hey there**,

Have you ever blown it in an interview because your lack of conversation skills killed any chance of getting hired?

Let's talk honestly...

...**have you** ever experienced that moment while in an interview where your mind just seems to shut down.. And the harder you try to think of something "cool" or "witty" to say, the more you retreat in your own head... and you can see in your interviewer's eyes that she is starting to realize that you're not as worthy as she thought you were a few minutes earlier...?

...**have you** ever "ejected" from an interview while it was still going good because you didn't know how to move your conversation past the "friendly level" to talk about "why they should hire you" and talk about "the main benefits of paying you money to work for them" so rather than to risk rejection or embarrassment, you say something stupid, give extremely short answers, or look stupid and keep your mouth shut because you're too afraid and got nothing...?

...**have you** ever felt "overshadowed" by other job applicants who seemed to be naturally be more charismatic talkers than you..like they seemed to effortlessly know all the answers to the questions and get jobs in a fun and sometimes flirty mood...while your conversations seem to be boring or 'try hard' in comparison...?

...**have you** ever got an invitation to an interview... but didn't show up... because you were terrified of the moment that when the recruiter begins talking to you... the struggle to think of 'what to say next'... the dreaded "awkward silences"... so instead you will worry about the interview for hours before finding a good rationalization not to show up... or just pretend you didn't exist and not show up at all without any word of advise...?

**Have you ever had any of these things happen to you?**

If you're like me when I first started to enter the "BPO job market," then you've been in one or more of these situations... probably MANY TIMES.

And what's the WORST part about going through one of these things?

Well, if you ask me, the most PAINFUL part of it is that as you're going through it, you always KNOW that it's YOU that's screwing things up!

And OTHER guys who are less educated than you, less skilled than you, uglier than you, worse than you are EARNING MONEY from YOUR DREAM JOB and YOU'RE UNEMPLOYED!

Like YOU WASTED all the effort YOUR FAMILY put into your EDUCATION.

**And it sucks!!!**

## "This Changes Everything..."

I know why you don't give up..

Because you know that finally figuring this out changes EVERYTHING

I think by now you "get it." And you know that it's not looks, education, backers, special skills, experience (these things mean nothing if you can't talk) that gets you higher paying jobs...

It's your ability to open up your mouth and talk to them in a way that gets them feeling comfortable and confident towards you... And once you master this... You can literally apply in ANY BPO job... and within seconds... create that "spark" that other applicants go their entire life without experiencing...

I know you've imagined it, yourself with the perfect interview smoothness... Able to walk into any interview, confident, introducing yourself, asking questions, telling them different stories about your life, and showing your "call center skills" by demonstrating how well you give "step-by step instructions."

...and it doesn't matter if it's a small company, a growing medium-sized company or a giant BPO company. You just get hired in any of them. No matter what the process.

...and you get EVERY interviewer, smiling, complimenting you, encouraging you, laughing at all YOUR jokes (even the corny ones) all while you easily transition from telling them about yourself to why they should hire you.

Not to mention the surge of confidence that radiates through all areas of your life... allowing you to have more fun and CONNECT with more people.. and it means having jobs and recruiters approach and chase YOU

It means an entirely new world where you have the courage to go after exactly what you want, and you get the RESPECT of all the people who don't.

Best of all, it means looking forward to going out and talking to interviewers.... and ENJOYING your conversations with them... And finally getting RESULTS...

You DON'T GIVE UP because you know exactly what this means...an you know this is WORTH LEARNING.

## "A Realization That Instantly Changed Everything For Me..."

When I was searching for *hidden secrets* on how to get better at talking to interviewers... I almost never found what I was looking for. There was a ton of great information on building your confidence, what attracts employers, body language, and interview answers...

But what I realized is that there are certain things you need to know to execute all of this...

- **You need to know how to TRANSITION all of these techniques into a conversation SMOOTHLY**...
- **You need to know how to instinctively know WHAT TO SAY NEXT**..
- **You need to know how to recover from those moments where your mind goes BLANK and you completely STALL OUT**..
- **You need to know how to TRANSITION a conversation from something fun and playful to something on a more PROFESSIONAL level**...
- **You need to know how to draw more ENGAGING conversations out of the interviewer that you are talking to**...
- **You need to know how to think quicker... how to "turn it on" instantly... and how to become more CHARISMATIC**...  

For a very long time, I became almost obsessed with the question "what do I talk about?"

When one of my friends or the people I met in the waiting area would get hired...I would shamefully pry "what did you say to her?"

And when I frantically searched online, reading other people's success stories, I always looked for the little snippets of dialogue that I would analyze and try to recreate.

Yet anything I found myself alone with an interviewer...  and knew I had that I had the perfect chance to connect with her... instead, my entire body would get tense... my voice would get creaky... and I'd find myself sort of shrugging and giving boring interview answers... and although she was being polite... I could tell that she WON'T be hiring me...

It's a lot worse... in a GROUP INTERVIEW...

Anytime I got around anyone even slightly outside of my comfort zone, I would start to feel this shell grow around me... and the harder I tried to crack it... the more I just murder my chances of creating any sort of connection in my interview.

Why did it seem the harder I tried, the more boring and UNNATURAL my conversations became?

## "My a Ha Moment"

I remember one night hanging out with a friend of mine who always passes interviews and gets hired... Within ten minutes of talking to an interviewer, this girl was inviting him to meet her boss for the final interview... I stood there stumped... the door was open... I can hear everything... There was no brilliant conversation... in fact, most of the conversation was pretty mundane... yet, the interviewer was giggling and having FUN the entire time...

Then I had a real "a ha moment" when I had a simple realization:

I realized that the guys who seem to do the best at interviews were NOT the guys who were able to have the most interesting conversations...

And it hit me!

It is not your ability to talk about interesting things with an interviewer that gets them to want you for the job... it is your ability to have fun together talking about NOTHING.

## "What if everything you thought you knew about conversation skills was wrong?"

It's your ability to have fun talking about NOTHING... read that AGAIN...and then again!

If this seems counter-intuitive to everything you thought you knew...or everything you have been TAUGHT it is not your fault.

Very few people "crack the code" and understand this concept.

I remember reading "interview tips" and being so FRUSTRATED because the post would seem that you would just copy an interview answer to get the interview going and use a few techniques..and WHAMO the interviewer would be dragging you to the next room to meet her boss for the final interview then contract signing...

No mention of all the long stretches of conversations between opener and close...

No mention of follow up questions...

The Small Talk

## "What The 'Interview Experts' Leave Out"

But as I read more and more interview tips, listened to more and more YouTube videos, and attended more and more call center trainings...

I began to pay attention to the subtle things that WERE NOT BEING DISCUSSED.

And here's what I found...

A lot of the advice being shelled out on conversation skills says "talk about something you're passionate about."

Makes sense, right?

If you put ANY person in a conversation with an interviewer and let that person talk about one or two topics he or she is passionate about... they'll do pretty good... right? At the very least, you won't stumble into those long awkward silences....

...That is until the topic runs DRY. And then you're DEAD in the water.

On the other hand, the people who really kick ass in interviews... the applicants with "jaw dropping" talent to almost seduce nearly ANY interviewer... the guy who has perfect JOB OFFFERS wrapped around his pinkies...

## "Great Conversations Talking About Nothing?"

These people are able to have great conversations with interviewers about essentially nothing.

These people have the interviewers smiling and laughing and telling jokes...during small talk... They naturally keep the conversation FLOWING... all the while, slowly moving the conversation to the exact direction THEY want to take it.

So much emphasis has been placed on what to say to demonstrate value, or what to say to show confidence, or what to say to impress the interviewer... that it is virtually never talked about how to have a flowing, FUN conversation, while weaving all of these techniques together...

In fact, the more I began to search through the piles and piles of information available on the internet, the more I begin to see just how WRONG this information actually is when it comes to creating charismatic and compelling conversations with interviewers.

## Your "Missing Link" To Interview Success

I'm about to tell you something that you already know...

I think you ALREADY KNOW far more than the average applicant about how to answer interview questions.

If you found my page, I'm sure you read other advice too.

In fact, you probably know more than most people who are "naturally" good at interviews.

You already know the "theory"... and what you need to do to be successful. But things just aren't working for you the way you wish they would...

And... I think you know that the problem stems from your lack of conversation skills and it is preventing you from ever having a real chance at building a connection with an interviewer.

You know "WHAT" you need to be doing. But you don't know HOW to do it. There is a big difference... I think you figured that out by now.

I also think you realized that this problem of not being able to communicate YOUR BEST SELF is not limited to job interviews.

I also think you know that if and when you DO tackle and defeat this problem... and get this handled once and for all... you WILL achieve the success with getting hired... your relationships... your family... and your personal goals will all line up and follow.

And I think you realize by now that this isn't going to happen by itself.

The problem isn't going to "solve itself"... the pieces aren't going to just "fall into place"... and you will NOT have the success with interviews you are looking for unless you DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

The good news is that this problems is not nearly as hard to fix as you imagine.

I speak from experience. There was a long time when I thought I was "different" and was just not capable of overcoming this area of my life...

But I was finally able to "fix it."

And now I want to show you exactly how I did it.

## Finally a Cure for Your Interviews

If you're ready to finally kiss your fears and frustrations of talking to interviewers goodbye... and give yourself the priceless skill of being able to approach any interview situation... spark their interest in you instantly... and talk free and flowing... and leave them wanting to hire you... I have some exciting news for you...

I've spent the last few years putting together a brand new, one of a kind program on "having conversations with interviewers that engage, connect and build interest"... and it's finally ready to rock.

This program was not designed simply to educate you on the ins and outs of having conversations with interviewers... and it's not going to give you a few great lines and techniques...

What this program is going to do is completely IMPLANT the skill of carrying a conversation with an interviewer into your game, brain and personality, and make it a PERMANENT part of you.

In this ground-breaking program, you'll learn the "subtleties of conversation" to pinpoint the _specific_ problems that are ruining your chances in interviews... that make you realize 'oh, I can easily go on from here'...

## Always Be "In the Zone" During Interviews

You'll learn how to draw people out to talk about more interesting topics in a more natural way instead of dragging it out to them. And the "mindset tricks" so that you can ALWAYS be "in the zone" with interviewers whenever you're talking to them.

What's unique about this course is that its based on examples and application... and filled with hundreds of little "bite size" game changers that you'll be able to see an immediate impact in your conversations tonight.

Before recording the program, I told the guest teachers "A little theory is fine... but we need EXAMPLES of things we can do tonight that drastically change the quality of our conversations... and we need EXAMPLES for all types of conversations with different objectives, for example, how to create small talk, working in the group interview, creating an emotional connection, making INSTANT friends, creating professional impression, warm approach, etc."

And above all, you'll learn tips, mindset shifts, and strategies that make you REMEMBER to use this stuff WHEN IT COUNTS when you're out talking to your interviewer... Because the biggest problem I've found over the years is that it is easy to learn something sitting at a computer... but a whole lot different trying to put this stuff into action...

So I designed SPECIFIC practice routines to make sure you drill these skills down and make them become a part of how you naturally communicate.

If you've tried EVERYTHING and you can't get a grip on what your problem is and how to solve it...this program is _especially_ for YOU.

## "Command Power and Respect From Anyone You Talk To, Almost Instantly"

If you're feeling like you don't have any control over your conversations... and that what you say is completely random... and it's a crap shoot of whether you're "in the zone" or in "boring mode" then this will show you how to break free from these CHAINS and take control of your brain back... and start commanding POWER and respect from all you come in contact with.

If you've had difficulty keeping a conversation interesting or consistently find yourself "blanking out" or "running out of things to say" this program will show you how to fix those problems, and easily talk for hours in a fun and exciting way.

If you're tired of not getting any sort of "buying signals" and job offers from interviewers... and just can't seem to ENGAGE her enough to ESCALATE past an "interview" level.... you'll learn how to snap yourself into "I always get hired mode" and make your "intent" so contagious that your interviewer naturally follows you into this new way of commmunicating... and you'll see EVERY conversation as a new opportunity to connect on a deeper more intimate level with every interviewer you come into contact with, whether it's a recruitment assistant or the CEO of the company.

I wanted to create a definitive "go-to" guide for Filipinos who are experiencing the same problems that ruined nearly two thirds of my life.

Now there are a lot of "self proclaimed" experts out there on the internet... and there is NO WAY I was trusting this project to anyone that was not THE BEST OF THE BEST.

I got together the best of the best and together we're going to share the skills you need to finally say "goodbye" to the problems and issues that have plagued you conversations with interviewers.

All of this is covered in the program...and a whole lot more.

**Here is just a few of the other things you'll learn:**

![IMAGE TEXT]({{ site.url }}/images/checked.png) How to Get Unlimited Job Opportunities

How to structure your conversations in way that creates                 a "greased slide"… (She gets in at the beginning, and is rushed at a                 giddy pace straight through every story, every word, every physical escalation                 until she arrives at the close, breathless and so excited that she can't wait                 for you to finally lean in and kiss her…)


![IMAGE TEXT]({{ site.url }}/images/checked.png) A "conversation technique" you MUST use in EVERY conversation that will let you know where you stand in the interview. This "rapport trigger" not only **creates an immediate and unconscious bond between the both of you... but it also gives you 100% effective way of knowing EXACTLY where you stand.. (this is one of those "true" over night game changers)

![IMAGE TEXT]({{ site.url }}/images/checked.png) **Learn to think "spontaneously" and be able to talk about ANYTHING on a moment's notice... once you learn this, you'll find yourself getting job offers in the mall, Starbucks or simply walking down the street...

What to do when an interviewer is fishing for a detail that you want to talk about (there is a right way and a wrong way to handles this... do it the wrong way and you've lost)... if you handle this right, your value in the interviwer's eyes will shoot through the roof...

![IMAGE TEXT]({{ site.url }}/images/checked.png) The "4 basig agreements" you MUST unconsiously make with an interviwer that will create almost "instantaneous rapport" and let them know you're both on the exact "same page"... they rarely meets an applicant who "gets it"... so when they do, they WANT TO HIRE YOU IMMEDIATELY.

![IMAGE TEXT]({{ site.url }}/images/checked.png) A simple "mental" exercise that allows you to **plow through any "awkward" moments of the conversation** with an underlying, unshakeable, inner confidence, that will prevent you from stalling out or getting nervous... allowing you to powerfully attract the job opportunities, that you thought you can only pway for... The higher the interviewer's position, the better this works.
