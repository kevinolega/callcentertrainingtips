The goal is to get you comfortable at expressing yourself in day to day conversations.

I will ask you to introduce yourself.

I will give you ideas on how to ask questions.

These activities account for over 93% of day to day communication.

In the second week, I’ll ask you to write 20 sentences per activity.

In the third week, I’ll ask you to write 30 sentences per activity.

At the end of the lessons, you’ll write over 1,000 sentences.

For pronunciation, our focus will be the use of the top 100 most used words in the English Language.

These words will be used in over 50% of all the sentences that you will be writing or speaking.
