## LESSON 2

Here's a list of probing questions. 

Here's what to do.

### Part 1

I want you to record yourself asking these questions.


### Part 2

I want you to write down an example of a practical situation where you use this question.

**EXAMPLE 1**

"Why do you think that is?"

Situation: 

You're having a discussion with a customer and you'd like more details about how he or she came to a conclusion.

"Why do you think that is" is an informal version of:

What do you think the reason is?

Customer: I feel that your product is more expensive than the competition.

Agent: Why do you think that is?

Customer: I feel that you charge higher because you use higher quality materials and offer premium service.

**EXAMPLE 2**

What were you hoping to accomplish?

Situation:

You are having a discussion with the customer. 

You're trying to understand the customer's actions and decisions.

You ask the customer about their goal to see the big picture.

Customer: I've checked different providers. I still haven't found the service that I'm looking for.

Agent: It's sounds like finding the right service provider is important to you. What were you hoping to accomplish?

Customer: That's right! I'm trying to get some work done but I also have limited budget.

I want you to research and use your imagination on how these questions are used in conversations.

The probing questions that I've selected are used in different areas of:

1. Customer service.
2. Technical support
3. Problem solving.
4. Consultation or Counseling.
5. Interviews.

The main purpose of probing questions is to get more information so you understand enough about the customer to make a proper recommendation.

Questions follow.
