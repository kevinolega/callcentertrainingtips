## Activity Deadlines

Our training agreement expires after 90 days.

From personal experience, we discovered that people who skip writing for three days or longer end up not completing the lessons at all.

## On Forming Habits…

What you do becomes a habit.

What you DON’T do also becomes a habit.

Please spend time writing every day.

Even if it’s just thirty minutes a day.

Even if it’s just ten minutes twice a day.

Set a schedule and commit to writing every day.

Turn off your notifications and focus on writing.

## Our Goal Is To Teach You Not Grade You

We’ll give you feedback and tips on how to answer better then ask you to repeat the activity with your new knowledge.

Instead of giving you a failing grade, we will allow you to try again.

Please redo all the activities that you need to repeat.

## Answer All Questions

The goal of the lessons is to help you help you communicate well in a social and work environment.

The writing exercises are designed to help you become competent at the following communication tasks:

- Introducing yourself and your ideas.
- Asking and answering questions.
- Giving detailed step by step instructions.
- Telling stories.

You have to be able to articulate your goals, plans, intentions, preferences, and ideas.

## Organizing Your Answers:

We encourage our students to practice writing on paper and their notebook. 

When you submit your answers, please type your answers on your computer or smartphone.

Please include the title of the lesson and your name in the subject of the email when you submit your answers.

For Example:

	Week 01: Lesson 1 - Mitzi Cruz

## I Don’t Have Access To A Computer

Many of our students don’t have a laptop or access to a computer.

After they receive the emails, they answer the questions in their notebook.

When they are done answering, they type and edit their answers on their smartphone.

They use a notes app, or Google Docs to compose.

They use email or the share function to send their answers.

## I Have Access To A Computer

If you have access to a computer, you may type in your answers and email it back to us.

Typing speed is also a factor in many modern jobs.

When you type in your answers, you increase your typing speed.

Please use Google Docs instead of Microsoft Word to share your answers.

## Should I Write On Paper Or Computer?

For best results, do both.

Write on paper when you’re outside or don’t have access to a computer.

If you experience a mental block on the computer, write on paper.

If you experience a mental block while writing on paper, write on your computer.

Encode your writing on your computer.

Edit your writing on a computer.

FULL ANSWER: Read Writing on Paper and Computer.

## Modules And Lessons

You need to complete your answers.

We need to check your answers before proceeding to the phone coaching session and the next module.

We are committed to helping our students have a smooth experience with upgrading their English skills.

We want to avoid giving the student information overload.

We don’t want to overwhelm you with many activities.

We will be sending lessons 1 to 7 first.

After we received all seven activities, we will check and ask the student to answer any incomplete activities before sending the next set of lessons.

We will ONLY send you the next batch of lessons after we have confirmed that you have completed the activities for the current week.
