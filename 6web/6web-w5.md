## INSTRUCTIONS

You know what to do by now.

Minimum number of sentences for the writing exercises is fifty sentences.

## READ THIS FIRST!!!

Congratulations for being part of the top 1%.

I'm super proud of you.

Most people get hired by week 2 or 3.

You're still here.

I have a few more techniques to teach you.

Thank you for staying with us.

I see a decent amount of success in your future.

Please remember to continue practicing.

Work on making sure that your bad habits do not stay with you.

When you get to week 5, we expect you to have a decent level of composition.

1. One sentence paragraph - CHECK!!!
2. Short sentences  - CHECK!!!
3. Specific words  - CHECK!!!
4. No generic, umbrella terms.  - CHECK!!!
5. No spelling errors and typos  - CHECK!!!
6. You read your writing carefully before submitting  - CHECK!!!
7. You write complete sentences  - CHECK!!!
8. You use conversational instead of formal words  - CHECK!!!
9. You removed redundant words  - CHECK!!!
10. You are more comfortable writing  - CHECK!!!

At this point, our main challenge is time.

To learn a skill, you need to put in practice time.

I've put in the best practice activities that I can think of.

I know that some of these questions may sound repetitive.

Asking yourself a question again and again often yields different answer.

If you asked me to "tell you about myself."

My answer would change depending on my mood, how much sleep I've had or whether I've eaten already.

In the same way asking yourself the same questions again and again can give you ingredients that get you better answers.

I'm in the middle of writing my second book.

I've rewritten some of the stories dozens of times.

I have stories from fifteen years ago.

I have realizations about details that I forgot to include in the story fifteen years later.

There are lessons that become more profound as you become older.

That said, do not hesitate returning to your notes.

Attempt to answer the questions again.

You'll realize that your answers have changed.

You'll also determine that your life has improved since you last attempted to answer the questions.

I've rambled long enough.

Let's go.
