### What to Expect

The goal is to get you comfortable at expressing yourself in day to day conversations.

I will ask you to introduce yourself.

I will give you ideas on how to ask questions.

I will ask you to give instructions.

I will ask you to share stories.

These activities account for over 93% of day to day communication.

The first week will be easy and I’ll ask you to write 15 sentences per activity.

In the second week, I’ll ask you to write 20 sentences per activity.

In the third week, I’ll ask you to write 30 sentences per activity.

In the fourth week, I’ll ask you to write 40 sentences per activity.

In the fifth week, I’ll ask you to write 50 sentences per activity.

In the sixth week, I’ll ask you to write 100 sentences per activity.

At the end of the lessons, you’ll write over 1,000 sentences.

For pronunciation, our focus will be the use of the top 100 most used words in the English Language.

These words will be used in over 50% of all the sentences that you will be writing or speaking.

### Help!!!
