## WHAT TO EXPECT

The goal is to get you comfortable expressing yourself.

I want you to be confident in professional conversations.

I want you to feel at ease during day-to-day conversations.

I will ask you to introduce yourself.

I will give you ideas on how to ask questions.

I will ask you to give instructions.

I will ask you to share stories.

These activities account for over 93% of day-to-day communication.

The first week will be easy.

I’ll ask you to write 15 sentences per activity.

I’ll ask you to write 20 sentences per activity in the second week.

I’ll ask you to write 30 sentences per activity in the third week.

I’ll ask you to write 40 sentences per activity in your fourth week.

I’ll ask you to write 100 sentences per activity in your sixth week.

You’ll write over 1,000 sentences at the end of the lesson.

I’ll fix your pronunciation.

We will begin with the top 100 most used English words.

These words are used over 50% of the time.

You’ll always use these words to complete your sentences.
