Hi there!

If you’re new here, my name is Kevin and I write the lessons and maintain this site.

I'm the number one Call Center Job Hunting Assistance writer in the Philippines.

I pay 100% of the website hosting, yearly domain registration, web tools, hardware and sofware needed to maintain the blog using my own money.

I've been helping people get hired in a call center since 2005. That's thirteen years if you haven't considered the math.

If you haven't already, [send me a message to say hi][1]!

I answer every question I receive on text, messenger, email or calls.

I give out free reviewers to people you request them.

In fact, this page is actually part of a free reviewer.

I share my lessons for free on my website. If you check the list, it's all here.

I share some of my best lessons on Facebook for people who only have free Facebook data on my [training community][2] and [Facebook page][3].

I send updates, lessons, tips, special deals and opportunities to people who give me their email address.

[You can send me your email address here][4]. 

My blog contains every lesson I’ve written.

In terms of training I offer an intensive training package for a Php 2,500 and free self-study training through this blog.

This website is a library of hundreds of hours worth of lessons and activities that you can read and learn from.

That being said, I only help people who have a strong commitment to succeed. 

BPO work pays more than the usual Filipino companies because the work is tough.

You need to be physically, mentally and emotionally strong.

If you're not all three or not commited to become the person you need to be to succeed, then helping you is a waste of time.

I charge Php 2,500 for people who want to participate in my online training and private lessons and everyone I have guided have experienced improvements that moved them forward in their career.

With my help, you can become the hero of your family.

You will become the kind of person that you want and look up to.

I put this together because call center schools and call center training programs don't help people get better at English.

My training methods work because it incorporates the best practices from the best teachers that I have accumulated for over 10 years.

I have used accelerated learning techniques that will allow you to learn and apply the lessons faster than any class that you can take.

I am also part of one of the first call center training schools in the Philippines.

I hope you benefit and enjoy it as much as I enjoyed putting it together.

Here are the top articles that you should read if you want to get hired in a call center.

[Don't miss these opportinities because you can't speak in English][5].


[Read this if you want to know about call center basics][6].

### The Basics How To Succeed In Life and Call Center Work

Your mindset will dictate whether you will succeed or fail.

Anything you need to know can be learned.

English is a skill.

People skills are a skill.

Salesmanship is a skill.

Skills can be learned.

Nobody is born with skills.

People who are good at specific skills spend time, practice, made mistakes, learned and got better over time.

The first attempt often looks silly.

For things to change you need to change.

If I don't change, my situation will stay the same.

People who succeed are positive about finding solutions to their problems.

Negative people are passionate about how impossible it is to find solutions to their problems.

There are only one or two things that I need to work on and all I need to do is to get it right and then repeat that the few times and then the habit forms and eventually it becomes permanent.

The best way to learn is by doing.

Mistakes can be corrected.

A failure is an event not the person.

I can fail many times but I am never a failure.

If I fail, there is something wrong with my technique not with myself.

There are people who have done this (my goal) before and if they can do it I can do it too.

God has blessed me with all that I have and the ability to get better every day.

Nothing is instant everything in nature grow slowly.

There are no shortcuts.

I will continue to get better until I reach my goal.

Luck means preparation meeting opportunity.

I will give no excuse because an excuse is a lie that I tell myself justify why I did not get what I want.

In the event that I feel or am at a loss what to do next I will always remember that "the answer is always there and I just haven't found it yet."

Knowing this I will continue to search for the answer and I will not stop until I find it.

#### You Don't Need To Wait For Me

I'm honored that people ask me for tips on how to get hired. You actually don't need me to get hired. You don't need to wait for me to teach you. You don't need me to write your resume. You don't need to me to answer your question.

When I was younger I used to believe I need somebody to succeed. At times I would wait for weeks, months, even years to get to convince somebody to help me. Things never turned out as planned.

Got a friend who said he will refer you to their company? You can go directly to the company you want to apply at yourself.

Got a question you're waiting for an answer? Google it or you can find out yourself.

Waiting for a response to an email application? Walk in to other companies randomly.

Didn't know how your interview went? Ask the interviewer where you sucked at and ask for tips. When I got used to this, I asked as much questions as I could, extending my interview time to 30 minutes and sometimes an hour. One time the interviewer decided to recommend me for a job offer after just answering my questions.

The last one took the most courage. It also gave me the ability to go to the next interview more equipped and eventually, more confidently.

Ask your best friend to practice English with you. Tell them to write down every time you made a mistake or said something that didn't make sense. Discuss the alternatives.

It's an honor to be asked all these questions but I'm not always online. I have other things going on in my life. I also have [another blog][7]. I also [travel around][8]. I wrote the tips on this site to answer questions for people so I don't need to answer them one by one per person.

If you're asking for some tips please read my tips first and ask for specifics in case I missed out on some details.

Write your own guide. Borrow from the lessons you picked up from this site.

Don't use lack of something (information or skills) as an excuse for inaction. Instead ask yourself, if I never got (what you are waiting for) what do I do to get what I want?

My answer or whatever you are waiting for won't bring you closer to your goals. Your first steps will. Go ahead and start don't wait for me.
