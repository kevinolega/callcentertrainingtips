Hi there!

If you’re new here, my name is Kevin and I write the lessons and maintain this site.

I'm the number one Call Center Job Hunting Assistance writer in the Philippines.

I pay 100% of the website hosting, yearly domain registration, web tools, hardware and software needed to maintain the blog using my own money.

I've been helping people get hired in a call center since 2005. That's thirteen years if you haven't considered the math.

If you haven't already, [send me a message to say hi][1]!

I answer every question I receive on text, messenger, email or calls.

I give out free reviewers to people you request them.

In fact, this page is actually part of a free reviewer.

I share my lessons for free on my website. If you check the list, it's all here.

I share some of my best lessons on Facebook for people who only have free Facebook data on my [training community][2] and [Facebook page][3].

I send updates, lessons, tips, special deals and opportunities to people who give me their email address.

[You can send me your email address here][4]. 

My blog contains every lesson I’ve written.

In terms of training I do not offer personal training at the moment.

If you read and self-study the lessons on this website, you can get all my lessons for free.

Just click lessons at the top of the page.

This website is a library of hundreds of hours worth of lessons and activities that you can read and learn from.

That being said, I only help people who have a strong commitment to succeed. 

BPO work pays more than the usual Filipino companies because the work is tough.

You need to be physically, mentally and emotionally strong.

If you're not all three or not commited to become the person you need to be to succeed, then helping you is a waste of time.

If you are interested in private lessons, please visit our affiliate website and hire an English tutor.

If you apply the lessons that you learn from me, you can become the hero of your family.

You will become the kind of person that you want and look up to.

I put this together because call center schools and call center training programs don't help people get better at English.

My training methods work because it incorporates the best practices from the best teachers that I have accumulated for over 10 years.

I have used accelerated learning techniques that will allow you to learn and apply the lessons faster than any class that you can take.

I am also part of one of the first call center training schools in the Philippines.

I hope you benefit and enjoy it as much as I enjoyed putting it together.

Here are the top articles that you should read if you want to get hired in a call center.

You're probably here because you requested a reviewer.

I'm going to teach you a lot of lessons for free and if you go through them you'll be able to become successful with call center work.

Get a notebook and take notes.

If you find anything useful, helpful in your job application or a lesson that will improve your life, please write it down so you will remember. 

When you remember you are able to use your full potential.

**Don't miss these opportunities because you can't speak in English**

I get a lot of messages on a regular basis.

It goes something like. 
  
> Hi Kevin! I would like to work in a call center…but I’m not good at speaking in English.  

Then they ask me if they can get around not speaking in English.

People tell me that they are considering non-voice accounts or local accounts because they do not speak in English well. 

Another common comment that I get is that I’m good at speaking in English because I work in a call center. As if speaking in English had little application outside call centre work.

Some people tell me they want to find work but they can’t get hired because their English is not good enough.
  
Whenever people ask me for advice my answer is:

You need to invest in yourself.

How much income you make is equal to how much you have improved your self and your skills.

If you spend time studying and practicing English or any skill you desire to learn you will get better.

I did this every day until my skills were good enough.

English is a required life skill. 

That’s what I believe.

The reason why you’re not where you want to be in life is not just because of your poor English communication skills but because of your refusal to improve your English communication skills.

You miss opportunities in life because you are afraid.

You miss opportunities in life because you’re lazy.

You know what?

You’ll have bigger problems by avoiding this small problem.

If your intention to improve your life is genuine then you should invest every effort and resource in improving your English.

If you don’t then you are doomed to a life of minimum wage. 

**Getting a good job**

Interviews in high paying jobs and foreign employers are conducted in English. 

Consider this. 

The high pay or anything above fifteen thousand pesos and the good benefits that will secure your family is only available to people who can speak in English well.

Imagine this.

You will never qualify for an acceptable income if you refuse to learn a basic skill. 

It’s like you want to be a chef and you can’t even boil an egg.

How much time have you wasted on Facebook, games and Telenovelas since you stopped going to school?

Learning enables you to qualify for higher pay.

Whether you want a job with a good employer or to go abroad to work. 

Communicating well is required.

Remember this.

Filipino bosses are the worst bosses in the world because in the Philippines, it’s every man for himself. 

Nobody cares if you starve to death.

Maybe you're close to your family, but if you honestly care about each other, you have the obligation to become financially successful so you don't pull them down with you.

There are many Filipino and Filipino Chinese employers who don’t care for the welfare of their employee. 

Many of these wicked employers will try to get away with paying you less than minimum wage.

They have nice cars because they pocket cash instead of paying you the benefits.

It’s common practice to hire people as trainees to pay them less and to put them on permanent probation or contractual employment agreements to avoid paying them basic government mandated benefits.

In a lot of cases, you need to check with SSS and PAG-IBIG if your payments and contributions are being remitted to the necessary government agency.

Its that terrible.

Many honest employers require that you speak in English.

If your English is not good then you’re not qualified.

Dishonest employers take advantage of this. 

They will hire you cheap because you can’t go to better employers. 

Because you lack the basic English communication skill, companies who exploit their workers thrive.

It’s because you’re not qualified for higher paying jobs, you don’t have a choice.

You get low pay. 

Your benefits get stolen.

You become doomed to be poor.

If you're a woman, your only chance is to marry somebody rich.

If you're a man, your woman will be stolen by someone rich.

I've been there and it's not a happy situation.

I almost killed myself several times and it took me over five years to recover.

You don’t have any advantages because you can’t speak in English.

Even if you’re a hard worker, honest, patient or you have other special skill that’s not enough because you can’t communicate what you can do.

English is the skill that allows you to put your foot in the door. 

English allows you to communicate to non-Filipinos, how good you are.

**Not getting a job in a call center **

Call center is the highest paying job with the lowest specific educational requirement.

Imagine this.

You can take a job with no specific college educational requirements. 

Any course is accepted.

Incomplete college units are accepted.

High school graduates are accepted.

You don't have to be particularly good looking.

You are not required to trade sexual favors for any advancement.

This is probably the easiest.

Unless you're open to trading sexual favors to advance in your career.

You just need to have basic English skills.

You just need to read and follow instructions.

You just need to ask Americans questions about their account, listen to their problems and tell them what to do next.

You will have to take a deep breath and say "don't worry, I'll do my best to assist you" at every call.

Eight hours a day for fifteen to thirty thousand a month.

You can use the extra money to get online work or start your own business.

If you can’t get hired in a call center what makes you think you can qualify for a better life? 

Imagine getting promoted as a manager or going abroad with poor English.

It sounds like a disaster.

How will you talk to the owner of the company?

How will you ask for support if you need funding for your project?

If you’re Filipino and you can’t speak in English. 

Not speaking in English is a fucking disability.

**Making a good impression**

People who can speak in English well, always makes a good impression.

If you speak in English, people see you as educated, intelligent, refined, a person of class and substance.

Speaking in Tagalog when you are in an interview and the interviewer is speaking in English will give potential employers the impression that you are unprofessional, lazy, uneducated and poor.

No offense, but you should be offended.

You might be thinking this is so harsh.

That’s the fucking truth.

I have experienced this first hand.

People are polite and will just point you away but this is the truth.

Kanto-Speak, jejemon and just bad English turn people off.

Stop it.

It will make you sound silly.

Unless you’re already rich and successful then this part doesn’t matter.

**Extra Money that you can get**

Before working in a Call Center I worked in the mall.

Other than the manager, I’m the only person in a team of twenty four sales people who can speak in English. 

Whenever the customer is foreigner or an English speaking rich folk, everybody called me.

They say they are, in their exact words “nose-bleed” and I should talk to the customer. They give me half their commission and the client goes with me.

In a lot of these jobs, customers see me as the boss because my English is good. 

It’s just English but it’s a big advantage.

Even if you choose a non call center job English will give you an edge over the lazy folk who didn’t study.

**Getting promoted at work**

In a past job, I was working for a tech company under a boss who was newly promoted. Her name is Ramona Cruz or something like that.

She had good sales skills and a large network of people to sell to. She was able to bring in two clients so she was promoted.

I worked with the CEO of the company and he taught me how to present what we were selling and I copied it perfectly.

I was asked to come with her and do sales presentations for her.

The thing is, because I spoke in English, the customers wants to talk to me instead of her. 

This happened multiple times. 

As a result she was afraid because management might change their mind and conclude that her promotion was undeserved and that I am more qualified and will take her job.

To prevent that, every time a client calls and looks for me she tells them that I’m out of the office and will take the message on my behalf. She will then not give me a message. She then reported to her boss that I am not handling my client well and they are complaining about me not calling them back and this eventually got me fired. 

Had this happened under a different employer I would be promoted instead and there would be two teams competing.

If you’re good in English, you can get promoted and people will have to play dirty to beat you.

**Connecting with high performers**

Don’t you notice that whenever Anne Curtis or Toni Gonzaga plays the role of the boss, they speak in English? This is also true for John Lloyd Cruz.

That’s because high performers speak in English.

It’s a basic fact.

It the business circle it’s okay to speak in Tagalog if you are speaking with the owner and they prefer to speak in Tagalog.

If you are talking to an employee English is expected among managers.

In the professional circle English is the preferred language.

So if you would like to learn from higher performer you need to learn English.

The solution is getting educated. 

> ”Formal education helps you get a living. Self education helps you make a fortune”  
> - Jim Rohn

Here are two ways that I use to educate myself.
1. Read. You are what you read. You are what you study. Study the best materials.
2. Observe. Smart friends are the short cut to learning faster. 

When you read and practice what you learned you can get better. 

I created this blog to provide a collection of free self study lessons.

I also offer paid training and books if you need extra help.

**Call Center Basics**

I also have a video version of this page. Please scroll to the bottom to watch the video.

In this page we will answer the following questions:

- What is a call center?
- What is a BPO?
- What is a call center account?
- What is inbound and what is outbound?
- What is B2B and what is B2C?
- What are the common call center jobs?
- What are the job application requirements?
- What kind of computer skills are required in a call center?
- How long is the job application process?
- Pre-Employment Checklist

### What is a Call Center?

> Wikipedia says:A call centre or call center is a centralised office used for the purpose of receiving and transmitting a large volume of requests by [telephone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone). A call centre is operated by a [company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company) to administer incoming product support or information inquiries from consumers. Outgoing calls for [telemarketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemarketing), clientele, product services, and debt collection are also made.

That’s true. The real question is:

## What the is a call center for me?

**For different people there are different answers.**

- For a business owners it’s a place to outsource business related tasks we’d rather not handle on our own.
- For some entrepreneurs it’s a business opportunity.

**But that’s not who I wrote this blog for.**

- You just retired from your work voluntarily or involuntarily and you’re bored with staying at home and looking for a source of income a call center maybe for you.
- You’re a fresh graduate, looking to earn some money for yourself or to start a business later on. Maybe you feel it's a bad way to invest your time to take a job that pays below minimum wage.
- You’re a new graduate and you can’t find a job in the field of study you took up in college.
- You’re a single mom looking for a way to make ends meet.
- You have someone you can’t support, who needs a job.
- You want to learn business practices and how some foreign companies operate.

**The call center is in no way the prefect solution. I myself am not currently employed in one. The pay is pretty okay and the shifts vary and you may like it or not like it depending on your lifestyle. I present it as a stepping stone to other opportunities like:**

- Funding your going back to school budget.
- Funding your own business.
- Funding your migrate to abroad plan “I hope not!”
- Paying for expenses and a source of income while you figure things out.
- etc.
Whatever it is it’s not limited to that. Use your imagination friend. That will be all for now from me.

What is a call center for you? 

**Trivia: One of the most common messages that we receive is "Hi I want to be a call center, can you give me some tips"**


### What is BPO?

One question we often get asked is what is a BPO and how is it related to call center work.

In this post we will discuss what a BPO is and how knowing about it can help increase your chances of getting hired in a call center.

Understanding what a BPO is will enable you to understand what kind of job you are getting in to and as a result you can prepare better. 

BPO stands for business process outsourcing. 

A business process is simply a seriece of steps necessary to the survival of the business. 

Example of business processes include:

- Sales process
- Customer support or customer service process.
- Order taking process
- Collection process.
- Document processing.
- and so on.

Outsourcing is asking someone to do something for you and paying them for it. You outsource something because:

- it’s cheaper (cost-effective)
- they can do better than you (quality)
- you don’t have the time to do it yourself (convenience)

**We outsource tasks regularly.**

- laundry shops are places where we outsource our laundry
- fast foods and restaurants are where we outsource our food preparation
- public transportation is where we outsource our transportation needs.

Business process outsourcing is the same as outsourcing our tasks, except they’re outsourcing business processes. Almost any business process can be outsourced. **Here are common outsourced business processes in a call center.**

- Customer Service
- Technical Support
- Sales

These are the top three. A lot of Call Center Jobs are in these three fields. There are more but you’ll find out about that later. 

Was I able to explain this part clearly?


### What is a call center account?

I often get asked "What is a call center account?"

If you're new to the call center or BPO industry it is one of the first few call center words that you will learn about.

In this short post we will discuss what a call center account is.

When you get hired in a call center, you will be doing work for your call center but you will also work for your account.

The call center account is "the client" that your call center company is serving.

Several companies who offer call center related work do not do outsourced work for their mother company. Many companies serve other companies and offer business process outsourcing ( ie call center related) work for them. An account is who the call center does business for or in other words the company you will be representing once you start to work there.

#### Here’s an example:

Say, you work as a customer service representative for a call center company called Sitel and their account is Apple Computers then when you answer your phone, you say “Thank you for calling Apple Computers!” instead of “Thank you for calling Sitel”. You are not employed by Apple Computer but you represent apple computer because they are your employer’s client.When you work in a call center, the company you represent to the end consumer is not always the same as your employer.

#### So remember:

In a call center, Account means your employer’s client that you represent.


### What is inbound and what is outbound?

**A call center makes and takes calls. Inbound and Outbound refers to the direction of the calls.**

- Inbound means, you are receiving the calls.
- Outbound means you’re giving the call.

**There are both inbound and outbound calls to different business processes. Here are some examples:**

- Inbound Customer Service is when a customer calls to make inquiries, follow up on requests or get an issue resolved.
- Outbound Customer Service is when an agent call the customer to do a follow up on a customer’s request, solve problems and/or close support tickets.
- Inbound Sales involves a sales agent answering sales inquiries, processing orders and offering promotional packages (also called up-selling)
- Outbound Sales is when an agent reaches out to leads or prospects to offer products or services. This is also called telemarketing.

**Will I get assigned to an inbound or outbound account?**

I don’t know. It usually depends on what account is urgent, available and matches your profile. It also varies from company to company. Do you want an inbound based call center job or outbound based call center job?


### What is B2B and what is B2C?

**B2B**

Business to business means your work involves offering or servicing other businesses as a primary activity. You are talking to business owners or employees of other companies.

**B2C**

Business to customer means your work involves offering or servicing customers or your company or client's comany as your primary activity. You are talking directly to the customers.

Which is better? It depends. B2B is often more predictable but requires a higher skill level as far as English, communication skills and professionalism goes.

### Common Call Center Jobs: (Customer Service, Sales And Tech Support)


There are a lot of different business processes being outsourced in the Philippines. Call center companies receive outsourcing requests and projects from multinational companies abroad and from small and medium enterprises.

Locally, call center companies are starting to accept call center projects from local companies and some local companies are now putting up their own internal call centers.

Call Center Jobs are solutions to problems so if you would like to accept a call center job you must first understand that you are providing solutions to a problem. At times it will be uncomfortable (at first) or stressful (if you’re not doing it correctly) but that’s why they pay you.

As professionals we are paid to solve problems. What we can do to improve the situation is to try to improve ourselves bit by bit.

### Here’s a short list of the most common call center jobs in the Philippines:

-   **Customer Service** – Customer service agents often handle service requests, inquiries, follow-ups, complains, etc.
-   **Technical Support** - Technical support agents (or representatives)often handle troubleshooting, help desk requests that are mostly technical in nature or specific to certain technologies.
-   **Sales Representative** – Sales agents or (representatives)handle the money making aspect of the business where they offer solutions to clients or prospects in a form of products and services.

I personally believe that it’s a good idea to learn a bit about the three roles because one skill would complement the other. I might write about that in the future. Remember that these jobs can be both inbound or outbound. There are more but these are what we’re going to talk about in detail on the next post. What kind of Call Center Job would you want?


### Call Center Job Application Requirements

The call center industry is an equal opportunity employer.

Recruiters working for call centers don’t care if you’re tall, short, fat, thin, rich or poor or whatever.

As long as you pass the call center job application requirements, you will get hired.

Call center hiring managers are only interested if you can get the job done.

If you can prove in a call center interview that you can do the work, you are guaranteed to land a job at the company.

That’s all you need to remember about getting hired in a call center.

**Call Center Job Application Requirements:**

**Conversational English Skills**.

Having good communication skills are required for the job.

You’ll be talking mostly in English so you better polish up this skill.

It doesn't have to be perfect. You will be reading from a script most of the time.

Your English just needs to be good enough for small talk, asking questions, explaining your process, giving directions, and telling short stories.

Avoid making pronunciation errors like B and V, P and F, and finally TH sounds. We have several exercises on [this call center tips blog](http://callcentertrainingtips.com).

You can check out the top 100 used words in the English Language and check your pronunciation.

Practice with a friend who works in a call center or is good at speaking in English.

Think in English so you don't need to translate before you speak. Read in English, Write in English, Pray in English and Speak in English whenver you can. The more you do this the easier it is for you.

Speaking in English is like growing a muscle. More exercise, more growth.

**Willing to work night shifts and graveyard shifts**.

Many call center companies work for clients in the United States.

The usual work schedule is the opposite of Philippine Time.

When I worked in a Call Center we followed, Eastern Standart Time. Some of the shifts I've taken starts at 8pm, 1am, 2am and 4am Manila time.

It's a little difficult to adjust to.

As long as you have discipline and you can say no to distractions and invitations this shouldn't be a problem.

Leave the house and arrive at your workplace an hour earlier if you haven't done so yet.

**Can start immediately**.

Call Center companies want to hire agents immediately.

Despite the advantages, A lot of people quit call center work. Some for personal reasons and some for better job offers.

That said reputable call center companies are always hiring and they need to hire agents immediately.

They want a call center agent who can start as soon as they can because call center recruiters have deadlines to fill with their accounts with a specific number of agents. An unfilled position is bad for their business so they want to hire agents fast.

**18 years old up to around 50plus**.

There doesn’t seem to be a limit when it comes to age requirements.

You might feel you're too young or too old but like I said, you can prove to your interviewere that you can do the job, you are good as hired.

**Can use a computer**.

Technical skills are an advantage but just so you don't get confused, call center companies don't require you to be really good with a computer.

You just need to navigate or know how to use one.

##### Basic Computer Skills Required for a Call Center Agent Position:
- Can turn on computer.
- Can use Word to open, save and edit files. A resume would be a good example.
- Can browse internet to Google search, email and use Facebook.
- Can access tools like, calculator, notepad.

Most of the time, you’ll be working from a phone line attached to a computer.


**High School Graduate and up**

Several reputable call center companies that I know are open to hiring high school graduates and people who didn't finish college.

There are some call center companies that require two years or a degree because of client requirements but there aren’t a lot of them.

Sometimes the college requirement can be bypassed by call center experience with US or UK clients and working in a difficult account.

A college education isn't as big of a deal today than it did in the past so it shouldn't be an obstacle to you getting hired in a call center.

Many of my friends used call center companies as an income source to pay for college so that option is available for you. Just don't tell them you plan to work while studying. If your interviewer asks about it tell them you need to save money then after one to two years you might be taking classes.

Here are the requirements to getting hired in a call center.

Whatever else you have to offer is a plus.


### What kind of computer skills are required in a call center?

Depending on what kind of call center work you’ll be doing computer skills are important. Forget that, computer skills are a basic skill in life right now. A lot of people I got to talk to tell me that they do not have computer skills or aren’t computer literate. When I asked further questions, I found out the opposite to be true. So instead of writing about the required call center computer skills, I’ll just ask you a few questions to determine your computer skill level. Are you cool with that?Great! Like you have a choice.

- Do you have a facebook (friendster, twitter, blog, etc) account?
- Did you type your resume in a computer?
- Do you check your email account?
- Do you know how to shut down a computer?

Congratulations you’re computer literate. **Advanced questions:**

- Do you know how to search for things in Google?
- Do you know how to save your files in a USB flash drive?

Very good. You’re knowledgeable with computers. 

I’m not playing with you. That’s all you need to know about computers. Some companies will require that you can type around 20-30 words per minute (sometimes, more) but that can be learned. There are games for that. Go to Google and search. Free typing games or typing tests. I prefer typing games over the serious ones. It's as boring as hell. 

You can also increase your typing speed if you write a blog. I now have a typing speed of close to 40wpm because I want to type faster so I can just type my thoughts on the blog post as if I were just dictating it. It does take some time though.

#### Where did this fear come from?

Some people are just too lazy to learn and they make excuses. 

The other honest mistake is that they believe that someone who’s good with computers is someone who can tear open a computer and put it back together or do programming and other stuff like that. That’s not what call centers need. 

Call center companies need someone who can answer the phone and type in some information on the computer. They need you know basic stuff like where the keys are. Maybe copying and pasting text and stuff like that. Do you understand? Good. 


### How long is the job application process?
Many call center companies follow a one day process when it comes to processing their applicants. This means you can already find out if you pass or fail within the same day. That"s a good thing because you would know when it"s time to move on to the next one.

If you fail the best thing to do is to move on to the next one. Don't forget to write down the lessons on your notebook though. That's what you need to to keep going.

Failure is part of the process. You want success you need to collect lessons from failure.

A one day process can mean anything. If you start in the morning the longest you can stay in the process is maybe in the evening already. Maybe if you start in the afternoon then you will end up in late at night or the next day already.

The longer they let you stay the better. That means you are moving forward with the process. Don"t forget to ask your interviewer or proctor for tips for the next step.

I hope you do well.

### Pre Employment Checklist

When you look for work, aside from passing interview and exams you'll need to submit some pre emp

Pre employment requirments are a common chore that needs to be done to finalize your job hunting process. Items in a pre-employment checklist are often standard for most call centers and most jobs I've applied in. In case it's your first time to apply, or it's your first time to apply in a long time here are some of the documents that you'd like to prepare in advance. I took this list from a couple of my past employers. I found some lists as I was cleaning up.

Primary requirements are often required immediately (usually the same week or the week) after hire date.

#### These are the Call Center Pre Employment Requirements in the Philippines

**SSS Document E-1 / E-4 /E-6 dully received by SSS.**

In some situations you can get this same day and in other situations they require you to return after three days or so. 

I recommend paying the extra 100 pesos to have it delivered. It will often cost you more than Php 200 if you'll go back to just pick it up. 

**Police Clearance** (original copy). 

You just need to visit a nearby police station to obtain this.
