Hi there.

If you’re new here, my name is Kevin and I write the lessons here and maintain this site.

If you haven't already, send me a message to say hi.

You can also join the small [Facebook community](http://facebook.com/callcentertrainingtips) you can message me there and we can be Facebook buddies.

I would love it if you [sign up as an email subscriber](http://eepurl.com/riFT1). That way I can send you a message and send you new lessons on my site.

If you go to the archives it contains every lesson I’ve written.

This site has hundreds of hours of lessons and activities that you can read and learn from.

In terms of training I offer intensive training for a fee and free self-study training through this blog.

I hope you benefit and enjoy it as much as I enjoyed putting it together.

Here are the top articles that you should read if you want to get hired in a call center.
