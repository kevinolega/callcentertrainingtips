Let's talk about what employers really check when you apply for work.

I'm providing a list of everything they check.

Not everybody checks every detail.

But if you are a normal person.

And you look for new work.

Or better work.

On a regular basis.

All of these questions will come up.

This is also.

How I judge people.

When I hire for our company.

Let's begin!

## What do recruiters see when they look at your resume?

Do you have an email address?

Does your email address look professional?

## What do recruiters see when they look at your employment history?

Will this person resign early?

Is this person loyal to his or her employers?

Is this person going to treat his supervisors well and support them in achieving their company targets?

Will the company benefit from hiring this person?

Is this person a good hire or is he or she a traitor?

## What do you need to do with this information?

These are common questions that recruiters ask themselves when they talk to you.

Whether you are talking to the HR, Recruitment staff, Hiring Manager or Business Owner, they are often silently asking these questions to themselves as they talk to you.

You can ask yourself these questions and match it to how you approach your job application.

Then you can make corrections.

Go over these questions again and again.

So you can get your life in order.

Fix your resume.

Fix your social media profile.

Fix your appearance.

Fix your English.

More importantly...

Fix your attitude.
