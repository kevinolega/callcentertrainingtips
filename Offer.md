Most people give up on their dream jobs... 

Not realizing how CLOSE they are to SUCCESS.

Compared to other Asians... 

Filipinos have the highest English comprehension and compatibility for BPO and Call Center work.

That's because we have an incredible relationship to American culture.

We all know Star Wars, The Avengers, IronMan, Batman, Superman, the Justice League, the Lord of The Rings, Harry Potter, Twilight and many more.

We saw popular US TV shows like Game of Thrones, Friends, How I Met Your Mother and more.

You know the names Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robin Williams and Michael Jackson.

Other Asians don't.

They have their own culture.

And only pay attention to local media.

We were the first on Friendster, Facebook and YouTube.

If you finished High School, you already have ten years of English practice. 

Usually, people worked with just need to learn and correct 20 mistakes with their English to pass BPO interviews.

Maybe 30 to be sure.

If you're really challenged, let's make it 50.

People who claim to have problems with English Grammar only need to do a few writing exercises to fix their English.

You might only need to memorize 50 sentences to pass a Call Center Interview.

You probably need only 100 sentences to get Regularized in a Call Center.

## I CAN HELP YOU.

This page is part of my community service.

So I give lessons on FB, the website (main), YouTube (new) and send activities via email for free.

What most people don't know is...

I also offer coaching for Php 250.

When you avail the 250, you get an extra set of training materials and three phone sessions with me.

My focus is interview preparation for call center work.

We’ll be correcting your mistakes and I’ll guide you until you get hired.

This is my community service so I’m only charging a small amount because it helps cover the expenses of maintaining my website and production cost of training materials and the salary of my team.

If you want to avail the coaching, payment is by bank deposit and sessions are done on the phone so I’ll need your number. Globe and landline is good. Or Skype if you have fast internet.

I just want you to remember...

That the option to pay and get extra time and get dedicated assistance from me is not available forever.

When I get busy with work, I don't accept training offers.
