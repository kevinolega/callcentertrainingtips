The **Small Book of Blessings** is a free guide that helps you build confidence and clarity—especially if you're currently looking for work.

Many Filipinos look for jobs when times are tough.  
If you're unemployed or facing rejection after rejection, it's normal to feel discouraged.  
We often take rejection personally.  
We let small defeats eat away at our confidence.

This book is the antidote to that.
