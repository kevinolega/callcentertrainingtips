I currently have a job working with American clients.

I'm a freelance project manager for an IT and HR company.

Iâ€™m currently not accepting additional work and business proposals.

I also spend my free time writing the lessons for this website and mentoring dozens of students a week who enrolled in my training program.

I also answer career questions on my email and FB page as my primary form of community service.

So I'm saying no to your offer to:

1. Take a new job/client.
2. Sell or promote your product/service.
3. Attend your event.
4. Hang out.
5. Invest in your business, product, service or whatever.

This photo represents my current number of obligations at the moment.
