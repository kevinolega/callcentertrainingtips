What happens during the interview?

## Tell Me About Yourself

My name is Kevin.

I live in ParaÃ±aque.

I previously worked in Makati.

I used to work in sales.

My previous job involves reaching out to decision-makers and sending a proposal.

We were selling products and services to other companies.

I want to work for a call center because of the high pay and the more predictable work hours.

I spend my free time writing, cooking, baking, blogging, going to the gym, going on road trips, and exploring with my bicycle.

And I'm excited to be here and started the interview.

## All Directions Your Interview Could Go

I try to answer as many questions as I can during the interview.

Then the interviewer asks about something that I said.

The real reason is they're interested in what I said.

The professional reason is they're grading my English.

My interviewers are required to listen to every word that I say and get me to talk more about what they find interesting.

Different people will have different interests.

If the interviewer is "all business," they would stick to asking about my work experience.

If my interviewer has a sales background, my next questions will include:

- Tell me more about your sales experience.
- What's the most expensive item that you sold?
- What's the most challenging thing that you sold?
- What's the easiest sale you made?
- Tell me a story about a specific sale that you made.
- What's the most significant amount of money that you made in sales.
- What is your attitude toward INSERT SALES TERM (quota, sales targets, prospecting, talking to foreigners, etc.)

If the interviewer is more traditional, I will be asked about the story of my education, leading up my most recent job.

The interviewer may also ask me to talk about my family and my relationship with my other family members.

To know more about your personality, attitude, and to build rapport before the business questions, the interviewer may ask you how you spend your free time.

If the interviewer is male and within my age range, he will ask me about my bike, cooking, writing, technology, blogging, etc.

From experience, men are often more interested in things and technical details.

If the interviewer is female, and about my age range, we talk about my experience baking, cooking, my travel experience, and blogs.

From experience, women are often more interested in people and relationships.

If the interviewer is an officer or owner of the company, there's additional emphasis on how well I could do the work.

The interviewer will ask you to tell stories about the most exciting topic that you shared.

I will be asked to connect my current work experience to their current hiring needs.

## Keep it Professional

I've heard this advice in person and read this on the internet many times.

Whenever you're asked to talk about something personal or not 100% related to the job or your responsibilities, you can decline giving additional personal info.

In the United States, to avoid discrimination, rules like these are observed during in the interviews.

I suspect this advice is targeted toward Americans.

So if, for example, if I feel that my lack of a complete formal education may prevent me from getting hired, I should say:

> "Are you interested in my past academic achievements, or do you want me to talk about how I can help your company?"
 
The advice was to lead the interviewer away from personal topics or topics that might negatively influence the hiring decision.

If the interviewer asks about something you don't feel like talking about or may negatively influence the hiring decision, you should change the topic.

> "I think we should stick to the most important thing here, and that's how hiring me will benefit your company." 

I've never had the confidence to deliver any of the above-quoted lines.

I figured that I just needed to give an excellent answer to the personal questions that I'll be asked.

That's because I'm an introvert.

I hate talking about myself.

And that's the reason why I had a difficult time making friends, getting a girlfriend, getting a job, getting clients, getting business deals, and more.

If I wanted to overcome this problem, I needed to FORCE MYSELF to do what I naturally hate doing.

I decided I'm just going to talk about myself and do my best to have fun.

The size of my comfort zone determines the size of my income.

If I get rejected because of anything personal that I share with my interviewer, I shouldn't be working there.

I'll just presume that I won't fit the culture.

And there is nothing worse than getting hired in a company where the culture doesn't match your personality.

The other reason why I decided to work on my personal stories is that my interviewers are people.

Businesses are composed of people following instructions.

HR, the recruitment staff, hiring manager, or even the director or CEO are still people.

They're interested in my skill.

They're interested in checking how well I express myself in English.

They're interested in finding out if I'm a good person to hire.

They're also interested in finding out if I'm a good person.

That's because if they hire me, they'll be paying me whatever my monthly salary is for as long as I keep working there.

If the company pays 25k a month, then they will have an obligation to pay me Php 325,000 a year.

So they have to be really careful about hiring me.

They want to get the most out of me.

They also want to make sure that I don't cause any problems on the job.

Asking about my personal background may not be the perfect way to find out if I'm the best fit, but asking me these questions are better than not asking.

This is the final reason why I'm okay with talking about my personal details during the interview:

The longer my interview conversations are, the higher my chances are of passing the interview.

So I don't mind talking about all my awkward past experiences.

## What other people do instead.

Many people research answers to interview questions.

They only talk about positive traits to describe themselves.

You should hire me because I'm:

- Honest
- Dedicated
- Hard-Working
- Reliable
- Dependable
- Flexible
- I have excellent communication skills.
- and any bullshit you can think of.

NOOOOO!!! 

Big NOOOO!!!

If a person says, you should trust me, you never believe that person.

If a person says they're honest, do not trust that person.

If a person says, you should lend me money because I'm a good payer, do not give that person money.

If a person says, I'm humble, just no!

If you were single and you were dating, and you hear the person say.

I make a perfect partner because I'm honest, dedicated, caring, hard-working, reliable, dependable, fun in bed, and your parents are going to love me.

You should run away.

In Filipino, we have a term for that situation and during phone coaching, and almost everybody recognizes what I mean when I say the words "nagbubuhat ng sariling bangko."

If you shouldn't do that during dating, you shouldn't do that during interviews.

If your dating, your goal is to be in a relationship.

If you're looking for work, your goal is to get into an employee-employer relationship.

You want the employer to trust you so they'll give you a job.

It's almost the same thing with the other relationship.

## Hiring Quota - Second Chance

The hiring staff has a quota.

They still need to get people hired.

So they have a strategy to give people who use positive traits a second chance.

They ask applicants to tell stories.

You tell stories to prove that you are who you say you are.

So if you're honest, you'll be asked a story about a time that you had to deliver bad news.

If you're dedicated, you'll be asked to tell a story about a time that you had to cancel a personal appointment so you can attend to a work obligation.

If you're hard-working, you'll be asked to tell a story about your most extended overtime.

If you're reliable, you'll be asked to tell a story about a compliment that you received from your boss.

If you're flexible, you'll be asked to talk about an experience where you're doing a task that's not part of your job description.

If you can tell that story clearly and confidently, you pass.

When you use positive words to describe yourself, you need to defend what you say.

Sometimes the conversation turns into a debate.

When a conversation turns into a debate, it does not end well.

## I have a different solution - I open with stories.

My solution is to use stories.

When I'm asked:

- What are your strengths?
- What are your weaknesses?
- Why should I hire you?
- Why shouldn't I hire you?
- Why do you want to work in a call center?
- What got you interested in applying here?

I answer with a story.

I answer with the same story.

I just move the details around because I want to acknowledge the question that the interviewer asked.

## Here's my usual story

I didn't have excellent communication skills.

I often find myself getting rejected by people at school.

I don't have a lot of friends. 

I couldn't get a girlfriend.

I'm not close friends with anybody in the popular crowd.

I was an extreme introvert.

I'm only interested in rock and metal music, video games, martial arts, anime, science fiction, fantasy stories.

During my first day in college, I sat next to the prettiest girl in class and asked her if she practiced kung fu.

When she said "no," I thanked her for her answer and stopped talking to her.

That's how bad my communication skills and people skills are.

I had to stop going to school because I couldn't communicate my goals properly to my parents.

I thought that I did my best, at the time, but from my explanation, they concluded that the best thing to do is to stop sending me to school.

I got rejected for a call center job so many times.

I got my first job because I was fortunate.

My interviewer is interested in martial arts and gave me a shot at the job because he is interested in me teaching him a few martial arts moves.

This was a sales job. 

So I learned the basics of sales during training.

I also learned that anything I needed to know can be learned.

Our trainer asked us to draw Superman.

Everybody's drawing of Superman isn't excellent.

But he asked us what would happen if we practiced drawing Superman every day for a year, five years, ten years or twenty years.

We all agreed our drawing skill would keep getting better until it was close to perfect.

He taught us that the only way that would happen is if we kept practicing.

Most adults can't draw.

But most people had some experience learning how to draw back in school.

Many of those people quit drawing after they leave school because, for most jobs, drawing is not a requirement.

So most people quit drawing, and the skill disappears.

And that lesson stuck to me.

If I don't quit, and I kept going, I can keep getting a little better, and eventually, I'll level up just like in a video game.

This is also my experience when I went to the gym and when I practiced martial arts.

And this works for any professional skill.

I may suck at the beginning, but if I kept going, I'd get better.

Then what's difficult will become easy and eventually effortless.

Anyone good at any skill simply has had a lot of practice.

If someone can do something, I can do that too.

Whatever it is.

So I passed the training.

I started working.

It was a sales job.

So I got rejected 96 times a day.

I wasn't doing very well in my first two months.

I hit my quota on my third or fourth month.

I did some math, and I realized I got rejected ten thousand times before I learned how to overcome my fear of rejection.

I took a real estate sales job.

I was also rejected for four months.

This was a heartbreaking experience because we had no salary.

Then I made one sale.

I got paid 90k.

I sold a total of 11M made a total of 300k in that job, then I left.

I tried insurance sales, that was a failure.

I only sold around 300k.

So every job that I took is a story about me being rejected and failing at the beginning, learning a skill, and eventually getting better.

Every personal skill that I learned from cooking to martial arts to riding a bike to driving is also a failure at the beginning.

## Why do you want to work in a call center?

NOTE: I'm using my answer from my last call center interview. I was 26 at the time so I'm going to use this for my example.

I'm 26 now. 

And I'm beginning to realize that I'm running out of time.

I'm looking for work that pays well and that the pay is more predictable.

My first years in my career were spent working in sales.

I made a higher income, and it was fun and exciting, but at the age that I'm in, I can't afford to have a big paycheck one month and a tiny or no paycheck some other months.

Because that's what happens in sales.

If you have a lot of sales, you get a big commission.

If you don't make a sale, you get nothing.

I know that reputable call center companies pay well and pay on time, all the time.

So that's why I want to work here.

The pay offered in a call center may not be as high as the potential money that I can earn in sales, but I like the fact that the salary is more stable.

If I get a stable income, I can pay for my expenses and purchase the upgrades that I've been saving up for.

The pay may not be as high as I'm used to, but I'm going to enjoy the stability, and I'll still achieve my personal goals with this salary.

It's just a little slower and that's okay.

I just need to become a little more patient.

And I know that many people find call center work difficult.

And that's okay.

My experience taught me that I'm going to do poorly at first.

But if I kept going, I can learn the skill.

And if I kept going, I can master the skill, and the job becomes effortless.

## Pause

What's your reaction?

That's the interviewer's exact reaction.

The next question I'm usually asked is about my expected pay and when I could start.

I don't have to answer any of the other bullshit questions anymore because I already shared with the interviewer what they needed to know about me.

That's enough to get hired based on my personal experience.

## Story Format

The story follows a critical format.

You want to talk about what you're trying to do.

You want to start your story with a weakness and an obstacle.

I talked about why I'm not a good communicator.

I talked about my personal failures because I wasn't a good communicator.

I talked about the consequences of being a poor communicator.

Then I talked about the story of how I learned the skill that allowed me to overcome my challenge.

I talked about the most important lesson that I learned.

And the story of how I kept going.

Think about your favorite stories.

It's always a story of a person who has a goal.

But that person is in a difficult spot and has a big obstacle.

That character just kept going.

Got a little better.

Met failure.

Kept going.

Got a small upgrade.

Met another failure.

Kept going.

Got closer to the goal.

Encountered the biggest failure.

Kept going.

Won at the end after all the struggle.

It's up and down.

Then it's up and down.

Then it's up and down.

Then the final big challenge.
 
Then finally, the big win.

Think about popular stories.

Iron Man, Captain America, all the Marvel and superhero movies, Batman, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Rocky, Kung Fu Movies, Dragon Ball, Naruto, Biblical stories and more.

It's a story about how people kept meeting obstacles, failure, and kept going.

We all relate to these stories because we all encounter obstacles.

And we all secretly want to give up.

And we're all desperately craving for a tiny push. 

We're all hoping to hear another story with another reason to keep going.

And if the interviewer hears this: 

- You gave them a reason to keep going.
- You gave them a reason to trust you.
- You indirectly told them that you're going to learn the job no matter how hard the tasks may be.
- You indirectly told them that you're not going to give up when you face challenges.
- You indirectly told your interviewer that you have skills and can learn new skills.
- You indirectly told your interviewer that you have the right attitude.
- You indirectly told your interviewer that you are a good person to hire.
- You indirectly told your interviewer that whether they hire you or reject you, you'll keep going.

## Note from Kevin

This is a long story.

That's why I asked you to write a story after each lesson.

That will be your practice.

I asked you to write 1-2 stories and sometimes 5 or more stories.

I expect you to write close to a hundred stories at the end of the 42 lessons.

Those little personal stories will help you put together your main story that you'll use for your job interview.

## Worst case scenario story.

You did all the activities, and you wrote your hundred stories.

And you don't have any exciting story to tell your interviewer.

Tell them this story.

I want you to complain about me.

I want you to call me an asshole and a scam for all the writing activities that I asked you to do.

## Here's an example.

I wanted to get hired in a call center, but I kept getting rejected.

Three companies already said no to me.

They told me I needed to fix my p and f sounds, th and d sounds, and a little more practice expressing myself.

But the worst rejection that I got is from myself.

I was criticizing my education, family history, status, and all my past decisions.

Then I got scammed online.

I met Kevin from the internet.

He told me he will help me get hired in a call center.

Then he charged me Php 250.

Can you believe that?

He took my money and asked me to perform A LOT of DIFFICULT writing tasks!

He made me do 42 writing activities.

Every lesson that he sends has a lot of pages.

The short ones have three to five pages.

The longer ones have 20 to 30 pages.

And I have to repeatedly write stories and write different instructions.

Kevin said it often takes 30 minutes to an hour or a little longer to finish each lesson.

My English is so bad, it takes me four to five hours to finish one lesson.

In one activity, he asked me to answer each question with 100 sentences.

He gave me six questions.

I had to write 600 sentences.

I used up 4 notebooks in the first week.

I hated it.

My hand was tired.

My brain was exhausted.

But I kept going.

When I ask Kevin a question, he sends me more lessons to read and activities that I have to answer.

Kevin never answers me directly.

I was also asked to do some research.

Kevin is a scam.

He said he would teach me.

He asked me to research some of the terms he didn't explain.

Sometimes I have to wait for days to get my answer.

So I got used to searching on Google for answers.

After I did all my writing on paper, Kevin asked me to encode all my answers on a computer.

I didn't own a computer, so I had to borrow or rent one.

I had to do a lot of work.

I thought it was easy.

I probably typed a few hundred pages.

I don't have any experience of using a computer outside of the time we used computers at school.

When I started, my typing speed was 10 words per minute.

I was so slow.

But Kevin, that asshole, he forced me to type all my answers.

Now my typing speed is around 35 words per minute.

Can you believe it?

Kevin is an asshole.

Kevin is a scam.

He said he'll help me.

He said it's easy.

But he made me work a lot.

He made me think a lot.

He made me write a lot.

He made me practice on the computer a lot.

I just kept going.

During phone coaching, he was pointing out all my grammar and pronunciation mistakes.

I was so frustrated.

I feel like a bad English speaker.

I don't feel good about this training.

But we fixed 35 grammar and pronunciation errors.

Then Kevin stopped correcting me.

He kept saying it was good enough already, and I should start looking for work.

So after seven weeks of that rigorous training, I decided to apply here.

Stupid Kevin.

## 1% Success 99% Failure

I learned about this when I was eleven years old.

And I didn't pay attention to this until I'm 34 years old.

It was 1998 when our family got our first computer and internet connection.

In 2020, people shared their thoughts and inspirational messages on social media.

Back in 1998, it was through email.

At that time, we don't have unlimited internet so many people developed the habit of printing their interesting emails and sharing the printouts to their friends and families.

The ones I kept in my room contained jokes shared by my mom and my uncle.

One inspirational message that I received was the law of the see.



## What does it take?

1% are abnormal.

They work hard.

They don't quit.

They make intelligent decisions.

They are disciplined.

They are consistent.
