## What is a Call Center?

> **Wikipedia says:**  
> A call center or call centre is a centralized office used for the purpose of receiving and transmitting a large volume of requests by telephone. A call center is operated by a company to handle incoming product support or information inquiries from consumers. Outgoing calls for telemarketing, client communication, product services, and debt collection are also made.

That’s accurate. But the real question is…

---

### What Is a Call Center *for Me*?

Different people have different answers.

- Business owners think call centers are places to outsource tasks they don’t want to handle themselves.  
- Investors see call centers as business opportunities.

But I didn’t write this for them.

---

### Let’s Talk About You

- You just retired—by choice or by force—and you’re bored at home.  
- You want to earn some cash.  
- You’re a fresh graduate.  
- You didn’t finish college and you’re worried about your future.  
- Your college course leads to jobs that barely pay minimum wage.  
- You want to help your parents, who sacrificed everything for your education.  
- You want money for yourself—and a little extra to save for a business.  
- You graduated, but you couldn’t find a job.  
- You scroll through job listings and can’t believe how low the salaries are.  
- You feel that taking a below-minimum wage job is a terrible way to spend your time.  
- You figured it’s better to change direction than keep walking a dead-end path.  
- You’ve realized that investing more into a poor decision won’t improve your outcome.  
- You’re a single mom trying to make ends meet.  
- Your office job pays the bills—but not enough to raise your kids on.  
- You have a family member who didn’t do great in school and needs work.  
- You’re pushing them to try applying at a call center.  
- You’re ambitious.  
- You want to learn how successful companies operate.  
- You’re curious about how foreign businesses are run.

Call center work isn’t perfect.  
But compared to many local job offers, the pay is solid.  
Whether or not you enjoy the work depends on your lifestyle.  

I present call center work as a **stepping stone** to help you move toward your long-term goals.

---

### Why I Started

My first goal was simple: save enough money to pay for my tuition.  
Later, I wanted to use my income to fund a business.

Other people use call center income to pay the bills while they figure things out.  
Some use it to save up and work abroad.

I used my call center income to continue learning and prepare for remote freelance work.

I’ve seen many people succeed using that plan.

---

### Have You Done the Math?

If you've never run the numbers, here’s what it looks like:

- ₱20,000/month × 13 months × 5 years = ₱1,300,000  
- ₱25,000/month × 13 months × 5 years = ₱1,625,000  
- ₱30,000/month × 13 months × 5 years = ₱1,950,000

> *That’s 13 months of pay per year—multiplied by five years.*

With resourcefulness and imagination, call center work can fund your goal—whatever that goal is.

---

### So, What Is a Call Center *for You*?

That’s the question only you can answer.

---

## What is BPO?

One question I often get asked is:

> What is a BPO?  
> What’s its relationship to call center work?

In this section, we’ll answer both.

Understanding BPO helps you see the bigger picture. It gives you clarity on the kind of job you're applying for and helps you prepare better for interviews and long-term success.

---

### What Does BPO Mean?

**BPO** stands for **Business Process Outsourcing.**  
A **business process** is simply a series of steps that keep a business running.

---

### Examples of Business Processes:
- Sales process  
- Customer support or service  
- Order taking  
- Collections  
- Document handling  
- And many more  

---

### What is Outsourcing?

**Outsourcing** means paying someone else to handle tasks for you.

---

### Why Companies Outsource:
- **Cost-efficiency** – It’s cheaper than doing it in-house.  
- **Better quality** – Professionals can do it faster or better.  
- **Convenience** – The company doesn’t have time to handle it themselves.

---

### You Already Outsource in Daily Life:
- You outsource laundry to laundry shops.  
- You outsource meals to restaurants.  
- You outsource transportation to jeepneys, Grab, buses, or trains.

**Business Process Outsourcing is the same idea—just for business tasks.**

---

### Most Common Call Center BPO Services

- **Customer Service**  
- **Technical Support**  
- **Sales**

These are the top three roles in most call centers. They're primarily voice-based and form the foundation of many BPO operations in the Philippines.

---

### Other Commonly Outsourced Services

BPO isn’t just about taking phone calls. The industry also includes **non-voice** and **specialized roles** that require different skill sets. Many companies now outsource:

- **Email and Chat Support** – Handling customer inquiries through written communication.  
- **Accounting and Bookkeeping** – Managing invoices, payroll, and financial reports.  
- **IT Services** – Helpdesk, tech support, and system maintenance.  
- **Web Development and Design** – Building websites, managing back-end systems, and creating user interfaces.  
- **Digital Marketing** – Content writing, SEO, advertising, and analytics.  
- **Social Media Management** – Scheduling posts, responding to comments, and managing online communities.  
- **Medical Services** – Medical transcription, billing, virtual assistance, and insurance processing.  
- **Legal Services** – Document review, legal transcription, and research tasks.  
- **Data Entry and Document Processing** – Organizing and processing business records and forms.  
- **Virtual Assistance** – Admin support for entrepreneurs and executives, often across time zones.

---

These jobs may be part of a **call center** or a **separate BPO unit**. Many non-voice positions require strong English skills, technical proficiency, and sometimes additional certifications—but they also offer higher pay and more specialized career paths.

---

### My Personal Definition

> **Business Process Outsourcing is an opportunity for Filipinos to work for companies from the U.S., Australia, and Europe—because of our strengths in cost, communication, and skill.**

We’re taking on jobs once done in other countries, and doing them well.

- Filipino culture has strong American influence.  
- Many Filipinos speak English fluently.  
- We understand Western customers and business practices better than most.

If you want to get hired in a call center or BPO, you need to communicate well in English. That includes:

- Speaking clearly  
- Listening attentively  
- Writing properly  
- Thinking in English  

These are the basics—and they’re what will set you apart.

## What is a Call Center Account?

I often get asked, “What is a call center account?”

If you're new to the call center or BPO industry, this is one of the first terms you'll encounter.

When you get hired in a call center, you’ll technically be working for your employer—the call center company—but you’ll also be working for an account.

### What is a Call Center Account?

A **call center account** is the **client** that the call center company is servicing.

Many call centers don’t handle work for their own brand. Instead, they serve other companies by offering business process outsourcing services. When you’re hired, you’ll represent one of those clients.

### Example:

Let’s say you work at Sitel, and your assigned account is Apple. When you answer the phone, you’ll say:

> “Thank you for calling Apple,”

— even though you're employed by Sitel. You are **not an Apple employee**, but you’re trained to represent them and follow their procedures because they are Sitel’s client.

This setup is common across all call centers. You work **for the BPO company** but **on behalf of the client company**—that’s the account.

---

## Remember:

An **account** is your **employer’s client** in a call center.  
You represent that client at work.

---

### LOB: Line of Business

In recent years, the term **“call center account”** has been replaced or complemented by another term: **LOB**, which stands for **Line of Business**.

A **line of business** refers to the specific service or focus area you are assigned to within a client’s organization.

### Examples of LOBs:
- **Customer Service**
- **Technical Support**
- **Sales**
- **Email Support**
- **Chat Support**
- **Billing**
- **Retention**
- **Back-office operations**

So instead of saying:

> “I’m assigned to the Amazon account,”

You might hear:

> “I’m assigned to the **customer service LOB** under the Amazon account.”

LOB gives a more specific picture of what kind of work you’re doing inside the account.

## What Does B2B and B2C Mean?

Thanks for sharing the next section! Here's the optimized and updated version of your original post for **“What Does B2B and B2C Mean?”**, ready for inclusion in the **Call Center Basics** pillar page:

---

## What Does B2B and B2C Mean?

These are two terms you’ll often hear in the BPO and call center world:

---

### B2B – Business to Business

**B2B** means your work involves **serving other businesses**.

In this role, you’re usually talking to **business owners** or **employees of another company**.  
This could involve technical support, service contracts, account management, or B2B sales.

---

### B2C – Business to Consumer

**B2C** means your work involves **serving individual customers**.

In this case, you're helping the **end users** of your client’s product or service—like retail customers, subscribers, or service users.

---

### Which Is Better?

**It depends.**

- **B2B** roles often require more advanced communication skills, professionalism, and product knowledge. But the interactions are typically more predictable and professional.
- **B2C** roles deal with the general public. They tend to involve a higher volume of calls and more emotional or unpredictable situations.

---

### What Should You Choose?

If you’re just starting out, it’s okay to take the **first good offer** you get.  
Focus on building your skills, gaining experience, and growing your confidence.

Later, you can aim for more **challenging and higher-paying roles**, whether in B2B or B2C.

> The more value you can deliver, the more you can earn. Start where you are, and build from there.

> 📞 Want to learn how B2B and B2C connect to daily call center tasks?  
> Read: [What Does Inbound and Outbound Mean?](/call-center-basics#what-does-inbound-and-outbound-mean)


## What Does Inbound and Outbound Mean?

In a call center, there are two main types of calls:

- **Inbound** – You receive the call.  
- **Outbound** – You make the call.

These terms refer to the **direction of the communication**, and each type applies to different business processes.

> 🧠 Want to understand how this connects to B2B and B2C work?  
> Read: [What Does B2B and B2C Mean?](/call-center-basics#what-does-b2b-and-b2c-mean)

---

### Inbound Customer Service
This is when a customer **calls you** to ask questions, follow up on a request, or report an issue.

### Outbound Customer Service
This is when you **call the customer** to follow up on their concern, provide an update, or close a support ticket.

### Inbound Sales
The customer **contacts you** to inquire about a product, place an order, or ask about a promo. You assist and may offer upgrades (also called upselling).

### Outbound Sales
You **contact the customer or lead** to offer products or services. This is commonly referred to as telemarketing.

---

### Will I Be Assigned to Inbound or Outbound?

It depends.

Your assignment usually depends on:

- The company’s current needs  
- Your skillset and profile  
- The urgency or availability of certain accounts

Every company is different. Some focus on inbound, others on outbound—and many do both.

### What Should You Do?

Start by understanding which one fits your strengths:

- Prefer helping people? You may enjoy **inbound** support.
- Like persuasion and pitching? **Outbound sales** might be for you.

Either way, both roles can be great stepping stones in your BPO career.

---

## Call Center Job Application Requirements

The call center industry is known for being an equal opportunity employer.

Recruiters don’t care if you’re tall or short, rich or poor, young or older. If you can meet the requirements and prove you can do the job, you’ll get hired.

Here’s what most call center companies look for:

---

### 1. Conversational English Skills

You don’t need to speak perfect English—but your communication skills must be strong enough for small talk, asking questions, explaining a process, giving directions, and telling short stories.

You’ll often be reading from a script, so focus on fluency and clarity.

Watch out for common pronunciation mistakes like:
- **B/V**
- **P/F**
- **TH sounds**

✅ Practice speaking, reading, writing, and even praying in English.  
✅ The more you practice, the more natural it becomes.  
✅ Think in English so you don’t need to translate every sentence in your head.

Speaking English is like building a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it gets.

---

### 2. Willingness to Work Night Shifts or Graveyard Shifts

Most call center companies serve clients in the U.S., which means your schedule is the opposite of Philippine time.

Some of my shifts started at:
- 8 PM  
- 1 AM  
- 4 AM  

Night shift takes adjustment. You’ll need discipline to say no to distractions, maintain your sleep schedule, and still show up with energy and focus.

Tip: Arrive one hour early to avoid rushing or being late due to transport issues.

---

### 3. Can Start Immediately

Reputable call centers are always hiring—and they usually need agents right away.

Why? Because:
- Some agents resign suddenly or go AWOL.
- Accounts have quotas they need to fill fast.

If you’re available to start immediately, you have a strong advantage.

---

### 4. Age: 18 and Up

There’s no strict age limit. Whether you’re 18 or in your 50s, what matters most is if you can perform.

If you can show the interviewer that you’re reliable and ready to learn, your age won’t be a problem.

---

### 5. Basic Computer Skills

You don’t need to be a tech expert, but you should be comfortable using a computer.

At minimum, you should know how to:
- Turn on a computer  
- Use Microsoft Word to open, save, and edit files  
- Browse the internet and use Google  
- Send emails and use Facebook  
- Access the calculator, notepad, and calendar

Most of your work will involve using a phone system connected to a computer.

---

### 6. Educational Background: High School Graduate or Higher

Many companies accept high school graduates, especially if you have good English skills and can pass the interview.

While some clients require at least 2 years in college or a degree, those roles can often be accessed later once you gain call center experience.

❗ **Important:**  
If you’re planning to work while studying, don’t say it outright in the interview.  
Instead, say you're focused on saving money now, and in the future, you may consider part-time classes—if your schedule allows.

---

### 7. Professional Attitude

Many Filipinos say call center work is hard—and they’re right. That’s why attitude matters.

You need to show you’re:
- Someone who **doesn’t quit when things get tough**  
- Someone who **looks for solutions** instead of making excuses  
- Committed to **perfect attendance**, especially during the night shift  
- Willing to **invest in getting to work on time**, even if that means taking Grab or a taxi when public transport isn’t available  
- Able to **maintain composure under pressure**, especially when handling difficult customers  
- Reliable when it comes to **following instructions, meeting targets, and showing up prepared**

A professional mindset is what separates those who get hired—and stay hired—from those who get replaced.

---

### What Do You Think?

Do you have what it takes to get hired in a call center?

In your notebook:
- List the requirements you already meet.
- Highlight which skills you need to improve.
- Create a practice plan if needed.

---

## Common Call Center Jobs

The most common call center jobs in the Philippines fall under three categories:

- **Customer Service**  
- **Technical Support**  
- **Sales**

These roles exist across different business processes being outsourced to the Philippines—from multinational corporations to small and medium enterprises. Even local businesses are starting to open internal call centers or outsource to local BPO providers.

At their core, call center jobs are about solving problems. If you want to succeed in this industry, understand that your main role is to provide solutions.

Yes, the work can be uncomfortable at first. It may even feel stressful if you're not yet familiar with the tasks. But that’s exactly why companies are willing to pay you.

Your job is to improve your skills over time so you can handle problems with more confidence and less effort.

---

### Customer Service

Customer service agents handle inquiries, requests, follow-ups, complaints, and more.

In this role, you’ll learn:
- How large companies handle customer acquisition and retention  
- The steps for ordering, support, refunds, and escalations  
- How to deal with difficult or upset customers professionally  
- How to stay calm, patient, and diplomatic under pressure  
- Communication skills that help even outside of work—like negotiating bills or dealing with customer service yourself

---

### Technical Support

Tech support agents assist customers with technical problems or product-related issues.

In this role, you’ll learn:
- The inner workings of products and services  
- Common troubleshooting methods and repair procedures  
- How to analyze problems clearly and offer step-by-step solutions  
- How to support customers who may not be tech-savvy—or who know more than you  
- How to become more analytical, precise, and solutions-focused in daily life

---

### Sales

Sales agents (or reps) work on the revenue-generating side of the business.

In this role, you’ll learn:
- How to turn conversations into conversions  
- How businesses use persuasion and promotions to make money  
- The psychology of motivation, need, and urgency  
- How to stay persistent and confident when handling rejections  
- How to reframe obstacles as opportunities—both at work and in life

---

### Kevin’s Notes

I personally believe it’s useful to learn a bit of each role. Here’s why:

- **Customer Service** builds your patience and people skills.  
- **Technical Support** strengthens your problem-solving and attention to detail.  
- **Sales** trains you to be more confident, persistent, and persuasive.

These skills complement each other and make you more valuable in any team.

Also: all three roles can be either **inbound** or **outbound**, depending on the account.

---

### What Should You Choose?

If you're new, take the first good offer you get. Don’t overthink it.

Start gaining experience, then reinvest your income into building your skills. This opens doors to more challenging and higher-paying roles later on.

---

### What Kind of Call Center Job Do You Want?

Take a few moments to reflect.

- Which of the three roles sounds most interesting to you?
- What strengths or experience do you already have?
- What would you like to learn?

Write it down—and let that guide your job search.

---

## Call Center Hiring Process

Getting hired in a call center typically involves several stages. Since you’ll be representing international companies—especially from the U.S.—each step helps recruiters assess your skills and fit for the job.

---

### Online Application

You fill out an online form and submit your resume to the company.

**Requirements:**  
- Resume  
- Internet access  
- Basic email and form-handling skills

---

### Walk-In Application

You apply directly by visiting the company office. Some call centers complete the recruitment process in a single day.

**Requirements:**  
- Printed resume  
- Valid ID  
- Pen and notebook  
- Proper attire and punctuality

---

### Computer Exam

You may be asked to take several assessments, such as:
- Basic English test  
- Business communication test  
- Typing test (25–35 WPM target)  
- Simple math and logic  
- Computer skills test  
- Voice tests using tools like **Versant** or **Berlitz**

**Requirements:**  
- Basic computer literacy  
- Typing proficiency  
- Listening and pronunciation skills

---

### Initial Interview

The recruiter asks about your background, goals, and personality. Expect these common questions:
- “Tell me about yourself.”  
- “What are your strengths and weaknesses?”  
- “Why do you want to work in a call center?”  
- “Why should we hire you?”

**Pro Tip:**  
Don’t memorize answers—**tell personal stories.** Talk about real experiences and lessons.

---

### Group or Panel Interview

You might be interviewed:
- Alongside other applicants  
- By a panel of interviewers  
- Or both

**Why I Like Group Interviews:**  
You get to observe other applicants. Pay attention to what works and what doesn’t. It’s a learning opportunity in real time.

---

### Written Exam

You may be given:
- Grammar and vocabulary tests  
- Multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions  
- Essay prompts (e.g. writing step-by-step instructions or narrating an experience)

---

### Call Simulation

This is a role-play.

- You play the agent (customer service, tech support, or sales)
- The interviewer plays the customer

**Tip:**  
Familiarize yourself with basic call flows. Many samples are available throughout this site.

---

### Final Interview

You meet with a hiring manager, HR head, or someone from leadership. The goal is to confirm your fit and verify the details from earlier stages.

They may re-ask key questions to see if your answers stay consistent.

---

### Job Offer

If you pass all interviews, you’ll be scheduled for a job offer session and contract signing.

---

### Basic Training

Some companies provide **pre-hire training**, which may include:
- English enhancement  
- American culture and customer service basics  
- Phone etiquette

⚠️ **Important:**  
- Be punctual.  
- No absences.  
- Don’t get too attached to fellow trainees.  
- People get eliminated for no-shows—even during paid training.

---

### Product Training

Once hired, you receive **specific training** about the account you’ll be assigned to.

In the call center world, **“account”** means the company you're representing (e.g. AT&T, Comcast, or Sprint—not the BPO company you were hired under).

During this phase:
- You learn about products, tools, and company processes  
- You meet your trainer and future team lead  
- You prepare for live calls

At Comcast, my product training lasted about a month before moving to OJT.

---

### OJT (On-the-Job Training)

You start handling live calls—supervised by a trainer or your future team leader.

**What to focus on:**  
- Arrive early  
- Ask questions  
- Apply feedback immediately

In my batch of 30, only 10 passed OJT.

👉 [Read: What happened to my 30 co-trainees](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/survivetrain/)

---

### Pre-Regularization Evaluation

If you last six months, the company may regularize you. Before that happens, they’ll assess:
- Your performance  
- Your attendance  
- Your intent to stay long term

Out of our 30 trainees, only 5 got regularized.

👉 [Read: How I was almost terminated](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/gerry)

---

## How Long Is the Call Center Job Application Process?

Many call centers follow a **one-day hiring process**—which means you could find out whether you passed or failed on the same day.

This is a good thing.

- If you pass, great—you move forward.  
- If you don’t, you can quickly move on to the next opportunity.

👉 **Tip:** Always ask for feedback. Then write down what you learned.  
Every failure can teach you something that helps you succeed next time.

---

### What Does a “One-Day Process” Actually Look Like?

A one-day process doesn’t always mean it’ll be over in a few hours.

- You might start in the morning and finish late afternoon.  
- You might start in the afternoon and end late at night.  
- In some cases, it can continue the next day.

In general:  
> **The longer the company lets you stay, the better.**  
> That means you’re progressing through the steps.

---

### Keep These in Mind:

- **Stay alert** – bring snacks and water; wear something comfortable but professional.  
- **Take notes** – write down lessons and reminders during breaks.  
- **Ask questions** – ask your recruiter or proctor what comes next and how to prepare.  
- **Don’t stop** – if one company doesn’t hire you, apply to the next one. Fast.

Failure is part of the process. Success comes when you keep moving, learning, and trying again.
