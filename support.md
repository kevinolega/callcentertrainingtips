- **[Create a Dropbox account so we both get free 500mb online storage](https://db.tt/vTWX3Qpf)**. This is perfect for saving your resume, having a private backup of your photos and files that you can access from any computer. 
- **[Create an Uber account so we both get free rides](https://www.uber.com/invite/kevino1009)**. Uber is better than taking a taxi. Install both Uber and Grab and you never need to buy a car in the city.
- **[Create a Grab account and we both get a Php 40 discount](https://invite.grab.co/2ED97C)**. Grab is an alternate to uber and beats taking a taxi. Install both Uber and Grab and you never need to buy a car in the city.
