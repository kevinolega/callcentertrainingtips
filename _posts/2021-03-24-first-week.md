I ocassionally receive messages from people who want to quit after they enroll.

The message is something like this:

> Hi sir Kevin!
> 
> I enjoyed your lessons.
> 
> I learned a lot. 
> 
> I've read everything but haven't done any of the writing.
> 
> I'm busy with my work, my life, my baby, my games, my houswork, my friends, watching YouTube, and everything else.
> 
> I don't have time to complete the lessons.
> 
> I don't have time to write.
> 
> I'm just happy reading.
> 
> Can you give me access to the other lessons?
> 
> I'd like to get the full value of what I paid.
> 
> TOOBUSYWITHEVERYTHINGELSE


HERE'S MY ANSWER:

You already got the full value of what you paid.

You don't need to finish the lessons.

I gave you most of the valuable lessons in the first set.

We offered six full weeks to give you more practice time.

We offered to give you more sessions so I can help you with your mistakes.

That's it.

Many of our students get hired after completing weeks 1, 2, and 3.

If you got to complete both week 1 and week 2, you already received most of what you need to learn.

Everything you receive next is mostly correction.

You'll only get this if you participate.

If you'd like to "just read" it means that you read the lessons but didn't understand.

NOTE ABOUT TRAINING:

We ask this questions before we allow people to enroll:

> Your lessons are not limited to paying, reading, then watching videos after you enroll.
> 
> You must participate in the writing exercises and phone coaching to sharpen your communication skills.
> 
> You need to read and follow all the instructions carefully.
> 
> Do you promise to give your best to complete all the exercises and participate in the coaching?
