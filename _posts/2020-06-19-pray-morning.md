Thank the creator of the universe for your blessings.

Ask for wisdom and ask for guidance.

Ask for the courage to do the right thing.

Ask for forgiveness and promise to make a sincere effort in making yourself a better person.

Religious people tend to pray in a quiet room.

Other people tend to pray while on the move.

I don't know which is better.

But either is better than not praying.

When you pray:

- You activate your gratitude.
- You become aware of your goals.
- You become aware that you have things to fix today.
- You make a vow to give your best.
- You summon the best version of yourself to work for you today.

If you're not religious, and you don't believe in God...

I don't have the time to debate or discuss that.

From my experience as a Catholic, Atheist, Agnostic, Christian and Philosopher, I summarize prayer as:

Prayer is programming so you can aim your mind and focus on an outcome.

You may...

Pray to the highest standard of being.

Pray to your best self.

Pray to your highest intelligence.

It's important to pray.
