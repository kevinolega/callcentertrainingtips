When you've reached your limit.

It's okay to give up.

When you have given your best.

When you've gone beyond.

When you realized you can't.

Even if you tried intelligently.

Even if you've gotten help.

Even if you did whatever it takes.

It's okay.

Success is not for everyone.

People with low IQ fail in life.

People with low ambition fail in life.

People who have nothing at stake fail in life.

People who have low emotional control fail in life.

People who have no discipline fail in life.

It is okay.

## According to statistics:

99% of businesses die in the first five years.

80% of Filipinos are in financial trouble by age 65.

More than half of all marriages end in divorce.

In sales and marketing, only one percent of the people who inquire to buy.

That means 99% of the inquiries lie to you and reject you.

Out of thirty trainees of COMCAST Batch 69a, only three agents stayed at the first year.

Only one person stayed for three years.

Me.

I became top agent.

I collected that sweet, sweet call center money.

I built the life that I want.

I went after my career and went after my dream income.

I succeeded.

## I succeeded because I understand this very simple lesson...

Everything valuable in life has a 99% failure rate.

If you expect things to always succeed...

Then you are FOOLING YOURSELF!!!

Success requires intelligence.

Success requires discipline.

Success requires emotional control.

Success requires effort.

Success requires courage.

Success requires positive action.

Success requires determination in the face of failure.

If you have none of those.

Or you are unwilling to put in effort to get all of those.

Well, let's put it this way.

Since we're being honest here...

## Let's talk about the truth.

The problem is not that you "can't"

Because if you want to, YOU CAN.

The true problem is you "won't"

Because you're afraid.

Because you're in pain.

Because you want to avoid rejection.

Because you want to avoid negative feedback.

So you are willing to stay small.

And stay poor.

And prove all the people who said you "can't do it"...

Correct.

You can unsubscribe to my email lessons.

You can unfollow me on social media.

You're free to do whatever you want.

But I'm sure.

Many years from now.

You'll remember Kevin.

The asshole from the internet.

Is speaking the truth.

It's okay to give up.

When you decide you don't want to.

But never say that you can't.

## Activity:

On your journal, write down all the times you wanted to give up.

**Questions to Ponder:**

What situations did I want to give up on things that are important to me?

Whenever I give up, is the reason of my problem, I can't or is the reason of my problem, because I won't?

Who am I failing if I give up on my dreams?

Who are the people who will benefit if I succeed at getting my dream job?
