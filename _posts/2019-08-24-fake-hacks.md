There are people who make YouTube videos about call center tips with annoying music and laughing in the background. 

There's always fake laughter between sentences.

That's because the only thing they're doing is tricking the audience into believing their fake hacks and shortcuts works.

The truth is...

You can't trick the interviewer into hiring you.

And even if you did, your life will be a living hell working in a call center if your English does not get fixed.

## When you get hired in a call center...

You will talk to a new American every five minutes eight hours a day five days a week.

If your English isn't good, your customer will hate you, your boss will hate you, and you'll probably waste 12,000 pesos because you lost the opportunity.

## Let me paint a clear picture for you...

When you try to get hired because of hacks instead of skill...

It's like faking your way into becoming a professional boxer and your next boxing match is with Manny Pacquiao.

If you listen to these losers, then you're about to learn a very important lesson about getting your information from the right sources.

It's not a hack that you need.

It's work.

Work on your skills.

Qualify for higher pay.

Shortcuts are the way these fake advisors try to fool you.

Don't listen to fake call center job hunting advice.

Work on your skills.
