How do winners become losers?

I'm 34 now.

When I entered the job market, I discovered that some of my friends had difficulty getting jobs and failing at businesses that their families started.

I was asking my friends, why don't you try this for your business or apply for this other job?

They usually gave me some excuse like:

I don't know about computers.

I can't speak English well.

I don't know how to sell.

I'm too ugly for that job.

I'm not smart enough to succeed in that field.

I tell them to buy a book, online course, or pay an instructor.

They often end up asking me where to get the pirated stuff.

I laugh and tell them you should pay for it.

It's worth it.

They tell me they don't have budget.

They tell me it's too difficult.

They tell me they don't have the time.

When Facebook came out these people regularly posted their vacations, outings, food trips, drinking sessions, new gadgets, mobile game achievements, but they don't have budget to learn new skills.

Many years later, I discover these people still in entry level positions.

Some of them have contacted me to borrow money, sell insurance, perfumes, MLM or network marketing opportunities and whatever.

I then remember our conversation when they told me they don't have budget for skills.

I'm not very intelligent.

I'm not naturally talented.

I don't have a lot of people who directly supported me.

I just know that if I don't know something, I can buy a book, pay for a class, buy an online course or pay an instructor.

A lot of the free stuff is okay if you have zero money, lots of time and no responsibilities.

I just learned the hard way that you get what you pay for.

As I write this, I recall that for as long as I remember...

I tell everyone I meet that I had zero musical ability.

I realize that the reason for that is I never took guitar lessons.
