Here are commonly used words with silent letters for your reference. There's no easy way to learn it other than being familiar with how it's pronounced. Familiarity is a result of repetition and over time you'll intuitively know which one has silent letters. Reading through the list I found out that I've been mispronouncing some words and its embarrassing to discover that it's a word I use often. Just read each one aloud. When my time frees up I'll produce an audio so you can listen to the pronunciation. For now just practice on your own.

## Some additional pronunciation tips:

1.  Always remember to practice.
2.  No need to memorize.
3.  Take note of what you're saying right and continue doing it.
4.  Write down what you're saying wrong and make corrections.
5.  Be patient and eventually you'll get it right all the time just like I do.
