I am not perfect.

Neither is anyone.

But when I go to a job application, everyone seems to be perfect.

There's always a temptation to "pretend that you're prefcect."

That's how we get into trouble.

Whenever someone tells me:

> "I tried applying in a call center but call center work isn't for me."

The person sounds like they're telling me that they're perfect.

They sound like they're done.

Like that's the highest level that they can reach.

I try to convince that person that they can change and improve.

Nothing happens.

People can only improve if they're humble enough.

If you're not working in your dream job, it means you need to make an effort.

You need to get better at what you're trying to do.

Sometimes it's learning new skills.

Sometimes it's making adjustments to your attitude.

Often, you need to do both.

If you've ever seen song and dance contests on TV, people are trying to get the big win.

These people are amateurs.

They compete but treat their performance like a lottery.

Professionals keep growing every day.

Professionals are required to sing and dance everyday.

They don't get judged like in a contest but they judge themselves everyday.

That is called discipline.

When you figure out how this works.

All your effort will be worth it.

Keep trying until you you succeed.
