This is the most widely used radiotelephone spelling alphabet.

We use this when spelling things out to the customer.

Some days, I'm speaking to a customer who does not recognize these words. 

After 3-5 failed attempts, I use common English names instead.

Some of the names are based on popular celebrities.

Some words stay the same.

NOTE: This is my personal method. 

You don't need too copy this.

But just in case, you're interested, I'm putting my list here.

A like Andrew

B like Beyonce

C like Charlie

D like David

E like Elvis or Edward

F like Friday

G like Golf

H like Holiday

I like International

J like James

K like Kevin

L like Lawrence

M like Michael or Monday

N like November

O like Oliver.

P like Patrick

Q like Queen.

R like Robert.

S like Samantha

T like Telephone

U like Unlimited

V like Victor

W like William.

Y like Yellow.

Z like Zulu
