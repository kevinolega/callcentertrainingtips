Attendance is always the most important KPI.

If your attendance is perfect, you can receive more second chances 

Early on, I understood the priority in our account.

The customer service score is the most important.

Getting a good number of sales is the second most important.

Getting a good QA score is the next most important.

AHT is at the bottom.

So I have always sacrificed AHT and QA in favor of PERFECT Customer Service Score and Sales.

How do I know this?

I don't.

I just based this conclusion from which metrics get's paid by the company.

Our company pays us an extra $80 for a perfect customer service score for the whole month.

Our company also pays us anywhere from $8-20 for each sale.

I'll work extra hard on tasks that pay extra.
