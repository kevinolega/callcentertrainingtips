Persistence overcomes resistance.

That's something to think about.

If you keep trying, you'll find a way.

If you give up, you'll find an excuse.

You are unstoppable until you decide to stop.

You have a potential greater than the greatest.

You are made of the same physical material as the most successful people on the planet.

You are in possession of a human body.

Whatever they can do, you can do.

Only difference is the attitude and the skill.

If you can acquire the attitude, you can acquire the skill.

If you are a loser...

If you are a failure...

That is your own doing.

**Bible says: God created you in His own image.**

My question to you is...

Are you a bad copy or a good copy?
