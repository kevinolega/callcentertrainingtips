I recommend that you begin writing as many sentences as you can about topics that you'll discuss during interviews.

I want you to have multiple options to choose from.

I want you to select the best answers.

The intitial answer to interview questions are often just 3 to 5 sentences.

The interviewer will ask for more details whenever you give an interesting or confusing answer.

Tell me more about... INTERESTING TOPIC THAT YOU MENTIONED.

What do you mean by... UNCLEAR ANSWER.

Give me an example of... SOMETHING YOU JUST SAID.

Tell me a story about a time where you displayed... POSITIVE TRAIT THAT YOU USED TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF.

Please elaborate on... TOPIC THAT YOU MENTIONED.

Not having an answer makes you sound like a liar.

I did think this situation over carefully.

I have a different conclusion.

I feel that you are speaking the truth.

You just have a problem.

Theres's a good chance that you

You have many stories in your head.

Your stories are however recorded in Filipino.

It takes 30 minutes to an hour to translate 200 words from Filipino to English.

There's also a good chance that you haven't thought your answers carefully.

I've found myself blurting out unprofessional thoughts during interviews.

I discussed conflicts with my family.

I talked about relationship problems.

I talked about personal problems.

These topics often distract the interviewer.

Interviews only give you ten to thirty seconds before they move on to the next question.

REMEMBER:

The interviewer is testing your English.

The interviewer is checking if you are speaking the truth.

The interviewer is analyzing your problem solving skills.

The interviewer is investigating if you have a good attitude.

The interviewer is observing if you are sincere with what you are saying.

The interviewer is judging if you are really prepared for the interview.

The interview is your opportunity.

HERE ARE IMPORTANT DETAILS THAT YOU NEED TO COMMUNICATE.

The company can hire you to do the job.

The company can depend on you.

The boss of the company can get you as a godparent to their kid.

The boss can depend on you to always be on time for work.

The boss can depend on you to always go to work.

The boss can hand you problems and expect that you will provide a solution.

The company can proudly tell everyone that they made the right choice in hiring you.

The company can use you as a model for the social media advertising.

The company won't regret hiring you.

The best way to communicate this message is by writing about yourself first.

The writing exercies that I designed are intended to help youy expand your ideas so you can pick the best answers for your actual interview 

I want you to write several pages about yourself and your plans ofr your life.

I want you to write about stories of your struggles.

I used stories of my struggles to convince interviewers to give me a job.

The more sentences that you have ready, the more you can say.

Showcase your communication skills during the interview.
