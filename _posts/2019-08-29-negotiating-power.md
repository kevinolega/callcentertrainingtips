How do you jump from earning 20k to 30k to 40k to higher?

Begin to pay for things.

Seriously.

If your confidence is low.

And you're not used to paying for value.

It's going to be incredibly difficult to charging more for the value that you give in return for your service.

If you expect to receive everything for free...

Then now matter what you do, you'll never learn this lesson.

You'll always receive lower pay in salary negotions.

You'll have no power to say to the interviewer...

You get what you pay for.

Zero power at presenting your value.

When you're looking for work to increase your momthly salary, being able to provide value and being able to communincate your worth is very important.

And you'kk never learn that lesson until you pay for value.

Professional people pay.

Cheap people don't.

You attract what yoou are.
