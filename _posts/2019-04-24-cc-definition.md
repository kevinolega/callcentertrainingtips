> Wikipedia says:A call centre or call center is a centralised office used for the purpose of receiving and transmitting a large volume of requests by [telephone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone). A call centre is operated by a [company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company) to administer incoming product support or information inquiries from consumers. Outgoing calls for [telemarketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemarketing), clientele, product services, and debt collection are also made.

That’s true. The real question is:

### What the is a call center for me?

**For different people there are different answers.**

For a business owners it’s a place to outsource business related tasks we’d rather not handle on our own.

For some entrepreneurs it’s a business opportunity.

**But that’s not who I wrote this blog for.**

You just retired from your work voluntarily or involuntarily and you’re bored with staying at home and looking for a source of income a call center maybe for you.

You’re a fresh graduate, looking to earn some money for yourself or to start a business later on. Maybe you feel it's a bad way to invest your time to take a job that pays below minimum wage.

You’re a new graduate and you can’t find a job in the field of study you took up in college.

You’re a single mom looking for a way to make ends meet.

You have someone you can’t support, who needs a job.

You want to learn business practices and how some foreign companies operate.

**The call center is in no way the prefect solution. I myself am not currently employed in one. The pay is pretty okay and the shifts vary and you may like it or not like it depending on your lifestyle. I present it as a stepping stone to other opportunities like:**

- Funding your going back to school budget.
- Funding your own business.
- Funding your migrate to abroad plan “I hope not!”
- Paying for expenses and a source of income while you figure things out.
- etc.

Whatever it is it’s not limited to that. 

Use your imagination friend. 

That will be all for now.

Please come back tomorrow for the next lesson.

What is a call center for you? 

**Trivia: One of the most common messages that we receive is "Hi I want to be a call center, can you give me some tips"**
