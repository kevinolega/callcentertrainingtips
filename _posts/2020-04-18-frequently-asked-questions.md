In the last ten years, I have answered thousands of emails from hundreds of people.

This is my part-time job — my community service. 

These are the most common questions.

### What should I do about my career?

Build your skills and slowly upgrade to a higher paying job.

### What should I do with my life?

Read “Happy, Smart, and Useful”.

### Can you introduce me to (famous person)?

No, sorry. Definitely not on request.

If my friends ask me if I know someone who’s doing what you’re doing, or have a specific need, then I’ll be glad to recommend you. But not if they don’t ask.

### Will you promote my thing?

Read “Why I don’t promote”.

### Will you invest in my company?

No, sorry. I’m not interested in investing in anything.

## Can I use your video / article?

Yes. Anything I put on this website is free forever.

It would be nice if you could credit me and link back to [callcentertrainingtips.com](https://callcentertrainingtips.com).

### Will you be on my podcast?

Maybe. Email me a list of questions you’d like to ask.

I enjoy interviews when the questions are interesting, and haven’t been covered before.

Here is the archive of my past podcast interviews.

Will you speak at my event?

Maybe. [Email me the details](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/contact).

### I’ve got content for your site.

No, this is my personal site.

No advertising, no income, no analytics, no tracking, nobody else’s stuff.

### I can’t focus.

Focus is one of the most important habits you can develop. The fear of being stuck at low paying jobs had me putting in all my effort to developing my focus.

I make sure that I get enough sleep.

I quit smoking.

I try to eat beef which is rich in protein and fat.

I exercise.

I meditate and used the Headspace app to teach myself how to meditate.

I take a shower at the start of the day.

I take a nap if I need a reset.

I also put my phone inside my backpack if I'm doing something I sincerely need to finish so it sometimes takes me a long time to reply to messages.


Yes it’s hard. Websites, games, apps, and media in general are designed to be as addictive as possible.

### I have a boring well-paying job. Should I quit my job to pursue my art full-time?

Read “[How to do what you love and make good money](https://sivers.org/balance)” by Derek Sivers..

### I’m a full-time artist, but can’t make money. What should I do?

I have a friend who worked in a call center while spending his free time making art. 

Eventually he built a reputation and earned good money from his side work.

### What do you think of this business idea?

It doesn’t matter what anyone thinks, except your customers.

Nobody can predict whether it will work or not. 

So stop asking “in-theory” because there's only one way to find out.

Find just one paying customer, and please that person. 

Start small and move up slowly as you become more successful.
