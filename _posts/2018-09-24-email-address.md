Let's start with the most obvious detail.

On your resume, at the top part of your resume, just after your name, you are required to include your email address and phone number as part of your contact information.

I know we have used email less because of social media but for professional communication, you are still required to use email.

The dumbest thing you can tell a recruiter, HR, prospective employer or client is that you "don't use your email as much" or worse "you have no email".

Some variations of this include "I lost my password or access to my email" or "I forgot my email."

Please stop!

These are equally bad.

If you don't have an email, please create one.

If you have an iPhone or Apple device, you actually will get an iCloud email with your Apple account.

If you have an Android device, you actually get a Gmail account.

You are supposed to have email if you are a professional.

It's also important that you check your email everyday.

Small details matter. 

If you have no email address, or no email address on your resume, you are telling your interviewer that you are NOT professional, computer literate, knowledgeable, dependable or qualified for a job that requires good communication skills.

Jobs that don't require an email address include mall sales clerk, fast food crew, maid, house boy, pedicab driver,` yaya, kargador, construction worker, security guard, promodizer, factory worker, etc.

Higher positions in business use email. 

If you don't use email or worse, have no email, Facebook Facebook lang, higher level professionals will look down on you.

Some notes:

Gmail is acceptable for business email.

iCloud is usually used for personal email.

Yahoo mail and Hotmail indicates that you're old and that you are not tech savvy or updated.
