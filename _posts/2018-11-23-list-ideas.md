Whenever I'm stuck with a problem, I force myself to think of 10 possible solutions on paper. 

If something is important enough and I'm desperate enough I write down my thoughts and solutons on paper.

I'm often able to come up with a solution with this method. 

Whenever I see the options and the solution on paper.

My mind bocomes free to choose the best solution and make a wise decission.
  
Back in school we consider mentally thought up solutions to math problems to be an amazing feat. 

The thing is , real life has more complex problems than basic math problems. 

If we're not familliar with the problem it's best to write it down and break it down and solve it piece by piece. 

Complex math problems are just several math problems joined together.

When you write things down, you can identify what you need to solve first.

Then you solve the problem, you can solve the next problem and keep solving until you are done.

If you're stuck, maybe take it a bit further by writing down ten ideas on how to implement your chosen solution. 

Just keep breaking down the problem into small parts and solve it. 

You'll get the hang of it. 

Need an exercise?

Write down a list for the following:
1. What are the instructions to commute to the office from your house?
2. What are the steps do you need to do to cook your favorite dish?
3. What is your advice to a friend with love problems?
4. What is your advice to a friend with money problems?
5. What steps will you take so you are never late?
6. What will you tell yourself to become patient with difficult people?
7. If you had unlimited money to spend on ten things, what are those ten things?
8. If you had unlimited money to spend helping people what ten projects would you do?
9. What are ten reasons why you deserve your dream income?
10. Who are ten people that you would like to help and what steps are you going to do to help them?
11. Bonus: What is the most difficult problem that you faced and what are ten possible solutions and steps that you considered? 
12. Bonus: What are ten steps on how you plan to become successful in life?
