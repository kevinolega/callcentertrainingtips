Many Filipinos avoid sales related work, making requests and negotiating because they consider it embarrassing.

As a consequence our culture has a GIANT disadvantage over other cultures in business.

With training, some people have overcome this disability.

My sales training has helped me overcome many obstacles in this area.

When a boss is telling me what's wrong with me, he is telling me what is wrong with my approach.

He is not telling me what's wrong with my identity.

At work, business is business, none of it is personal.

Humiliation is a word that people in sales and management don't pay attention to.

The mindset is.

What's the task?

What's the objectibve?

What tasks need to be done?

What's the next step?

When I was younger, I probably disagreed with 90% of what my employers taught me.

When I got older over half of those ideas I previously disagreed with made sense to me.

Don't pay too much attention to humiliation, it is never about you.
