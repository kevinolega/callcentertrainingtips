Every failed interview costs about ₱2,000.

Let's do the math.

How much does it costs a day to look for a job in the city?

It costs me about ₱200 to commute to an office in the city.

It costs me another ₱150 for lunch.

I may need to buy coffee or a snack later that day for ₱100.

I'll likely spend ₱50 to get my resume printed, use the internet shop, or put prepaid credits or internet on my phone.

That's about ₱500 for that day.

Is that how much money you lost?

Not exactly.

I believe you're smart.

Otherwise you won't be here.

I noticed that the people who appreciate my lessons are intelligent people.

You can now be confident people you'll beat in the competition aren't as smart.

You can get a job that pays ₱19,000 to ₱22,000 if you're smart.

I don't care if you're a beginner with ZERO experience.

I've met so many smart people who didn't finish college get job offers as high as ₱24,000 even if they don't have any work experience.

₱24,000 a month is ₱1,200 a day.

On to the painful math.

Every time you fail a job interview, you likely lost ₱1,700.

How did we get that number?

₱500 + ₱1,200 = ₱1,700.

Every day that you don't go out to look for work, you lose ₱1,200.

A minimum wage earner gets to earn at least ₱500 a day.

How many days have you been unemployed?

How much money have you lost?

I've met people who bow out when they discover that I charge ₱500 to ₱1,000 so for coaching.

One thing to consider is "how much money are you losing everytime you fail?"

How much money have you lost with every passing day that you don't have a job?

We have hundreds of people now working at their dream jobs.

How long do you want to wait to work at your dream job?

How much money are you losing by doing nothing?
