**Why Are Goals Important?**

In 2004 I took a sales job and the boss forced me to write down my goals otherwise I won't get endorsed for training. 

Because I didn't have a choice, I obeyed my boss. I didn't like it at first but writing my goals down changed my life.

About 80% of all my goals have been met.

Here are some examples:

- Get hired in a call center.
- Hit a sales quota.
- Rent my own place.
- Buy my own clothes.
- Start a bank account.
- Start a second bank account.
- Buy my own cellphone.
- Buy an iPhone.
- Buy a brand new Apply product.
- Buy my own laptop.
- Buy a Macbook Pro
- Get a Credit Card
- Buy a bike.
- Save more than 10k
- Save more than 20k
- Save enough money to work from home.
- Be financially independent.
- Help my mom with finances. 
- Make Php 20,000 a month.
- Work from home.
- Make money online.

Without goals your direction isn't steady.

So every year. I write down things that I want to happen. These are my long term goals.

I also set goals for six months and three months and track my progress regularly.

**Some tips about writing goals**

**Be Specific**. Write down details.
**Measurable**. Write how many. Write down the price.
**Actionable**. It needs to be something you can do something about.
**Realistic**. Do you know people who've done it or heard of people who've done it? If that's the case your goal is realistic.
**Timebound**. Write the deadline. Year or age or date. Remember the first step? Specific.

**Be** - What kind of person do you want to be?
**Do** - What activities do you want to do?
**Have** - What things would you like to have

Some lessons I've learned doing this for more than ten years.
- 85% of all the goals you write down will become reality.
- You need to read your goals regularly.
- When you know the goal it's easier to setup a plan.
- Goals that involve having usually involve buying something are usually expensive. (Car, house, gadgets)
- Goals that involve doing (activities) usually makes you happier and cost less money. (Travel, Activities, Etc)
- Goals that involve being or becoming the person you want to be costs a little amount of money and sometimes free. (Lessons, books, etc)

Here's a template of how I write down my goals.
