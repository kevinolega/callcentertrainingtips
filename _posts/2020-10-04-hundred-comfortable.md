I have a writing exercise where I ask my students to write 100 sentences about a topic.

The 100 sentences activity is a test that will allow you to become more comfortable in expressing yourself.

In an actual interview, your first answer is usually 5-10 sentences.

When you say something interesting, you get asked follow-up questions.

Professional interviewers are likely going to ask you about a topic six times.

How do you spend your free time becomes tell me the story of your favorite movie.

Where do you live becomes, tell me the steps that you had to take to get from Para√±aque to Makati.

When you copy an interview answer, you might encounter these follow up questions:

1. What are your strengths?
2. Tell me a story about a time where your boss asked you to cancel a personal appointment to go to work.
3. How do you feel about working on weekends and holidays?
4. How do you stay motivated?
5. How do you deal with stress?
6. What would make you quit a job?

Most people have a limited English vocabulary.

It takes forever to think of an answer or compose an English sentence mentally.

If you think of a sentence during the interview, your deadline is only 30 seconds.

The 30 second time pressure triggers a mental block that makes you look stupid in front of the interviewer.

Little by little, you'll lose confidence and eventually fail the interview.

During this exercise, you have as much time as you need. 

Your answer in the 100 sentences activity will help you answer ALL THE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS that you encounter.

If you can't even reach 100 sentences, how do you feel about working an eight hour shift speaking to 100 Americans a day?
