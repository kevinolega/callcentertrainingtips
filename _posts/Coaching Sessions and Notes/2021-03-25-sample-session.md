This is a sample phone coaching session.

We discuss the experience of the student.

We discuss grammar and pronunciation on session one.

I point out errors in the session.

We record all coaching sessions and share publish some of our sessions.

We avoid publishing personal information.

We ask our students to remove complete names and addresses from their answers.

We also give interview and career advice.
