This is a sample phone coaching session.

We discuss the experience of the student.

We discuss grammar and pronunciation on session one.

I point out errors in the session.

We record all coaching sessions and share publish some of our sessions.

We avoid publishing personal information.

We ask our students to remove complete names and addresses from their answers.

We also give interview and career advice.

This is the lesson from the video organised from the transcript:

Here’s the **organized lesson** based on the transcript. I cleaned up the structure, corrected unclear lines, and expanded on implied ideas to give learners a clearer guide.

---

## **Week 1 Lesson 1: English Writing and Speaking Basics**

---

### **Section 1: Why Writing is Hard at First**

- Writing feels hard because you are not used to it.
- Writing one-sentence paragraphs helps:
  - Spot grammar mistakes faster.
  - Improve clarity.
  - Make editing easier.
- One-sentence paragraphs improve both writing and speaking.
- You’ll learn to build better sentences over time.

---

### **Section 2: Why You Enrolled in this Program**

- Your main goal is to speak better English and get a job.
- You’re practicing English only—mistakes are allowed.
- Practicing in English helps you improve faster, especially for interviews.

---

### **Section 3: Identifying Speaking Challenges**

- Common issues:
  - Accent
  - Lack of confidence
  - Not used to speaking in English
- Practice helps build confidence.
- Mistakes are part of learning.

---

### **Section 4: Activity 1 – Self-Introduction**

- Your answers were mostly grammatically correct.
- Key issues spotted:
  - Avoid saying **“speak in English”**. Say **“speak English.”**
  - Capitalize proper nouns like **English**, **SM North**, **Montalban**, etc.
- Example of good structure:
  - Short, complete sentences
  - Clear ideas
  - Balanced structure

---

### **Section 5: Why Find and Fix Mistakes**

- Fixing a few small mistakes can make your English sound much better.
- One or two errors in an interview can ruin your good impression.
- Keep practicing and reviewing.

---

### **Section 6: Activity 2 – Practice Answering Hard Questions**

**How to Answer: “What are your advantages over other applicants?”**

1. Break the question into smaller questions:
   - Where did you study?
   - Do you have work experience?
   - What did you learn?
   - Can you work independently?
   - How’s your attendance?
   - Do you complain or solve problems?

2. Put answers together into a story.
3. Practice speaking the answer out loud.

> **Tip:** It's easier to answer hard questions when you prepare smaller answers first.

---

### **Section 7: Activity 3 – Giving Instructions**

- Giving instructions is an essential call center skill.
- In your past job, you did tasks for customers.
- In call centers, customers follow **your** instructions.
- Practice giving step-by-step instructions clearly.

> **Example**: How to commute to work – include start point, transfers, and landmarks.

---

### **Section 8: Activity 4 – Personal Story (Favorite Song)**

- Storytelling helps people understand and connect with you.
- Share emotional or meaningful stories with a clear message.
- Example: “Who Am I” by Casting Crowns helped you during your mom’s hospitalization.

---

### **Section 9: Activity 5 – Personal Story (Favorite Movie)**

- Use movies to explain values you believe in.
- Example: *Pay It Forward* teaches kindness and inspires action.

> **Fixes Noted**:
- Capitalize all major words in titles.
- Always end sentences with periods.

---

### **Section 10: Why Use Stories in Interviews**

- Stories make your answers relatable.
- Interviewers prefer stories over generic claims.
- Saying “I’m hardworking” is weak.
- Telling a story of how you worked hard is stronger.

---

### **Section 11: Bonus Exercise – Strengths Without a College Degree**

- Key Message: You may not have a degree, but you’re:
  - Responsible
  - Trustworthy
  - Diligent
  - Eager to learn
- Show your mindset and work ethic through stories.

---

### **Section 12: Bonus Exercise – Strengths from Growing Up in the Province**

- Growing up in the province builds:
  - Discipline
  - Obedience
  - Respect for authority
  - Strong work ethic
- These are valuable traits in the workplace.

---

### **Section 13: Final Practice – Your Self-Pitch**

- “I have what it takes to be a good employee.”
- Wake up early, do chores, set goals.
- Organize, prioritize, and maximize time.
- Learn new things (cooking, baking).
- Back up claims with proof:
  - “I’m a fast learner” → because I learned to bake on my own.
  - “I’m responsible” → because I manage my time and tasks daily.

---

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Use short sentences** for clarity.
2. **Capitalize properly** (names, places, English).
3. **Tell stories**, not just traits.
4. **Break down hard questions** into small parts.
5. **Practice speaking** what you write.
6. **Show your strengths** even without a degree through real examples.
7. **Use commuting and daily life** as practice for instructions.
8. **Avoid generic promises** like “I’ll work hard” without showing proof.
