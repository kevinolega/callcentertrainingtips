This interview technique is so effective, it's like punching unemployment in the balls. 

Or bringing a gun to a knife fight. 

This is one of my unfair advantages in an interview.

And I'm sharing this with you now.

I learned this technique from sales.

I pick up what I learn and eventually eventually apply the useful techniques to everything.

Asking questions mean you are sincere and interested.

And taking notes brings that sincerity and interest to another level.

So I treat interviews like a sales meeting.

As soon as the interviewer let me sit down.

I pull out my pen and open my notebook.

Sometimes, I feel lazy and don't do this until the interviewer says something interesting.

The interviewer sometimes looks surprired.

## You're taking notes?

He/she asked me.

Yeah.

I responded.

I don't want to miss important details.

I say.

## What details?

I get asked as a follow up.

I casually respond.

- Offers
- Perks
- Useful lessons
- Advice
- Interesting things

This also helps me make more intelligent decisions.

I say.

## You have other job applications?

Yes. I have a few interviews scheduled this week.

This reminds them that if they don't give me a good offer, I'll get my good offer somewhere else.

## This move helps me negotiate a higher salary

Having my notebook on me puts me in the best negotiating position if a recruiter tries to give me a low offer.

I can just say.

I understand.

If that's your maximum offer, that's your maximum offer.

I really enjoyed our conversation and you convinced me that it might be a good idea to work here instead.

I'm a little hesitant however.

Because OTHER CALL CENTER COMPANY is offering me a higher amount.

And I went here because I already said yes to you on the phone and I stay with companies for a long time.

And I want to make sure I'm making a good long term decision.

## My notes gives the interviewer a SOLID LAST IMPRESSION 

The notebook adds a lot of power to my questions in the last part of the interview.

Kind of like a finishing move.

## Do you have any questions for me?

The interviewer asked.

I ask the interviewer the following questions.

- Where do you guys eat during shift?
- Aside from the salary, what can you say are the best perks of working with this company?
- I would like to request for some advice. I'm new to the industry. *What traits do you see that top performers in your company have that made them top performers?* And *what's your recommendations for me?*
- If the interviewer said something interesting that we didn't get to discuss, I ask about it at this point.

## Other advantages of taking notes during interviews

I remember my interviewer's name.

I remember something the interviewer said that I find interesting and ask more details about it later.

I also collect notes on the usual salaries, perks and benefits.

I'm seen by the interviewer as more sincere and professional.

## Activity.

Get used to pulling out your notebook.

Ask people questions and write the answers down.

If you read or hear anything interesting, put it on your notebook.
