The most common request that I receive is:

> "Please evaluate my English."

This request comes in many forms.

Someone might say... 

- Please tell me if you think my English is good enough to get hired in a call center.
- Is my English correct? 
- Please fix my English.

When I began to teach English, I asked my students to expose themselves to the English language.

I don't mean watching movies, shows or videos but by speaking and writing.

I ask them to practice speaking until they are no longer bothered by the pressure of speaking in English.

I ask them to write as many essays on as many topics as they can so they have an English version of stories about their personal experience and good ideas.

In the past few years, I invested my money in learned about the disciplines of cycling, CrossFit, cooking, baking and boxing.

I've seen so many YouTube videos on bikes and asked so many of my friends who were experienced cyclists but I never learned until I bought a bike and started riding it every day.

Many of my bike lessons were learned from experience, riding my bike from Para√±aque to Makati every day and taking my bike to as far as Tagaytay and Subic.

I've seen so many exercise videos, read a lot of books and tried exercising at home but I didn't really understand what I needed to do until I enrolled at a gym and received instruction from a professional trainer.

I've seen several seasons of several cooking shows and read so many recipes and cookbooks but I didn't really learn until I practiced cutting vegetables and turning on the stove.

I've read so many martial arts books and watched so many fighting and boxing videos but I didn't really understand it until I enrolled in a gym and got punched in the face a few times.

The same principle applies to languages.

You can practice at home.

You can read books.

You can watch movies and instructional guides.

But the true practice is from using your voice and using your writing to communicate.

That's the reason why I often quiz my students to:

1. Introduce themselves.
2. Ask questions.
3. Give instructions.
4. Tell stories.

These are the main areas of basic professional communication.

When a company asks if you can work under pressure, they likely mean the above four.

Can you do the above four activities under pressure?
