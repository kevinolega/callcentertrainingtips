I realized early that I can avoid low paying jobs by improving my English.

So I made an effort to practice every chance I get.

Whenever I encounter family members or friends who speak English, I spend as much time with them as I can.

I ask them questions about their life and their personal beliefs.

People love talking about opinions.

I make them tell stories.

If they're employed, I ask about their job.

If they're married, I ask them about their family.

If we have similar hobbies, we can talk forever.

After listening to their stories, I often get the chance to tell my stories.

I do my best to spend an hour or two with them whenever possible.

I make an effort to treat them to a meal or coffee if there's an opportunity.

A short session is better than no session.

I try to speak to them in person or on the phone if they're not available.

I always thank them for their time.

They're the reason why I have advanced in my career.

I always pay the bill.

It's the least that I can do.

Friends and family members are usually kinder when we make mistakes.

If you make a mistake, they'll laugh a little.

Instead of keeping quiet for the rest of the conversation, you should ask them what you said wrong and how to say it better.

If you are afraid of making a mistakes, then you need to build the courage to make the mistakes because that’s the only way you’ll encounter the correction.

That’s how you get better at speaking.

A master has made thousands of more mistakes more than a beginner ever will.
