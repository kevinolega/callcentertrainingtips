Things I've already said are easy to write. 

I worked in sales.

As you may already know, I take notes during meetings and interviews, so I always remember the most critical details discussed.

At the end of the meeting, I write more details about what I remember from the meeting.

I close my eyes and recall what happened during the meeting and write down as many details that I can remember.

When I get back to the office, I'm supposed to write a report about what happened and what we discussed during the meeting.

I write down all the questions that I wasn't able to answer so I could get back to our prospect.

I wrote down the products and services the prospect wanted.

I wrote down the offers to avoid pushing to the prospect.

I list down the goals of our prospect, including the benefits and features that would make them happy.

I highlight the priority of the prospect.

I write down the prospect's budget.

We build proposals and presentations based on the information I've written.

I have made a habit of doing this for different sales jobs.

Initially, this was just a report that I need to email my boss.

I later discovered that this habit has helped me become better at connecting with other people and presenting myself better.

That's why, even if you're not interested in sales, I'm still sharing this lesson.

This is important.

Sometimes, there are situations where I realized that I misspoke during the meeting, and I correct myself by sending the other members of the meeting about what I was trying to say but felt didn't get to express clearly. 

Writing is my method of self-correcting.

I've also done this during dates and social gatherings.

If I met interesting people, I'd write down notes about them.

When I began journaling, I do this to remember what I did during the day.

I also kept a "what happened during work?" journal.

If I went out with friends, I wrote down where we went, what we ate, or bought so I can also track my expenses.

Everything I've said and done is easy to write.

Some of the topics that I've shared in the lessons are stories that I originally shared with friends and have turned into interesting discussions.

I want you to do the same with your writing exercises.

Whenever you're stuck, discuss with a friend and write down the most exciting details.

If they ask you what you're writing down, you may tell them that you are taking English lessons, and you're supposed to share something interesting in your homework, and you both just discussed something interesting.

If you're having trouble thinking of what to write, begin writing about what you already said and done.
