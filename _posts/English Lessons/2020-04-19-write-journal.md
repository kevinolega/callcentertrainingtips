Write your ideas and thoughts on your journal everyday.

Write everything that you want to say.

At the end of the week, read what youâ€™ve written down aloud.

Listen to how your thoughts sound.

If something is a little off, underline it and come back with a correction later.

You already have enough school to recognize wrong grammar.

You have already SEEN ENOUGH ENGLISH MOVIES to detect many small errors.

Edit your written English then repeat the process.

The clearer you are at writing, the better you get at speaking.

I see journalling as preparation for thinking and speaking.

You should do this too.
