Once upon a time, a 27 year old minimum wage job earner realizes the importance of earning more money to build a better future. 

After searching the internet he learns that call center work pays 25-35k/month so to improve his personal finances, sets out to try and land a job in a call center.

35k is 2.2 Million pesos after five years. He tells himself.

The worker is proficient at his previous job. 

Unfortunately, minimum wage job requires a different skill set to call center work.

He then finds out that good conversational English skills is required to get hired in a call center.

Because of a few failed attempts, he/she asks for advice on what to do to improve his English skills.

He finds three advisors...

The best friend.

A call center agent.

An English teacher.

He asks all of them the same question...

What should I do to improve my English?

Without a second thought, all three confidently gave him the answer.

And because the majority gave him the same answer, he decided to follow it wholeheartedly.

Just watch English Movies. They all said.

Just be confident. Everything will be okay. They all encouraged.

Our hero follows the advise.

And sets out to watch the most popular English movies.

In 2019, it was Avengers Endgame.

## What specifically does a person learn watching Avengers Endgame?

Some people move on. But not us.

Part of the journey is the end.

This is the fight of our lives. We are going to win. Whatever it takes.

I can do this all day.

I KNEW IT!!!

Avengers...ASSEMBLE!!!

Hey Peter Parker! You got something for me?

You missed the first time. Then you got them both the second time.

I am inevitable.

I am IronMan!

I love you 3,000.

Excited with what he learned, he watches more movies.

He then watches "The Lord Of The Rings"

## What specifically does a person learn watching the Lord of the Rings?

A wizard is never late.

You have my sword...

And you have my bow...

And my AX!!!

NOT THE BEARD!!!

YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!

PART 2

Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!

Tree?! I am no tree! I am an Ent.

MY... PRECIOUS!!!

PO-TA-TOES!! Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew.

What's it doing?! (Sam cooks rabbit) Stupid fat hobbit! You ruineds it!

I come back to you now, at the turn of the tide.

PART 3

I am no man.

What say you?

Release us!

Certainty of death. Small chance of success. What are we waiting for?

This day we fight!

Come on Mr. Frodo. I canâ€™t carry it for you. But I can carry you!

The ring is mine.

Not a lot of quotes but the music and the story and the lessons were memorable.

He later watches Star Wars.

All six Star Wars movies.

## What specifically does a person learn watching all six Star Wars movies?

EPISODE 1

The ability to speak does not make you intelligent, now get out of here!

At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge.

Wipe them out... all of them.

Feel, don't think...use your instincts.

Fear leads to the Dark Side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate. Hate, leads to suffering.

I ask you to help us. No, I beg you to help us.

Let's try spinning. That's a good trick.

NOOOOOO!!!!

Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an apprentice.

EPISODE 2

I hate it when he does that.

Good job! (sarcastic tone).

I don't like sand. It's coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.

I killed them, I killed them all. There dead. Every single one of them. But not just the men, but the women, and the children too. There like animals! And I slaughtered them like animals! I hate them!

That was brave, boy, but foolish. I would have thought you'd have learned your lesson.

I'm a slow learner.

EPISODE 3

I've got a bad feeling about this.

This is where the fun begins.

DO IT!!! (evil tone)

I am the Senate!

UNLIMITED POWER!!!

Do what must be done, lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy!

Execute order 66 (evil voice)

You're breaking my heart.

From my point of view, the Jedi are EVIL!!!

It's over Anakin!!! I have the high ground!!!

You underestimate my POWER!!!

You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.

I HATE YOU!!!

Arise Lord Vader.

NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

EPISODE 4

We're doomed.

Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.

I find your lack of faith disturbing.

Vader strangles officer with his mind.

Trust your feelings.

I got a bad feeling about this.

When I left you I was but the learner. Now I am the master.

Use the Force, Luke.

EPISODE 5

I can't believe it.

That is why you fail.

There is no try.

Impressive........most impressive

No, I am your FATHER!!!

NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!

EPISOODE 6

I love you.

I know.

IT'S A TRAP!!

Strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey towards the dark side will be complete!

NEVEERRRRRRR!!!!

I am a Jedi, like my father before me.

He goes to the next interview.

Interviewer asks him.

How do you spend your free time?

I enjoy watching movies sir.

What kind of movies? Said the interviewer.

I watched the Lord of The Rings, Star Wars and the latest was Avengers: Endgame.

That was an awesome answer. He thinks to himself.

What did you learn from the movies?

Thinks about the lessons but couldn't express himself.

Only remembers the quotes... 

The epic fights... 

The big battles...

The large armies clashing...

He remembers the pretty Liv Tyler who also played Bruce Willis' daughter in Armageddon.

He knows the King from the Lord of The Rings is in G.I. Jane and the Wizard was Magneto in X-Men and the Elf is in Pirates of the Caribbean.

And he should watch those movies too.

Star Wars was a little confusing but it was fun to watch.

Luke did kiss his sister.

The interviewer waited for three minutes.

But he couldn't answer.

Interviewer gave him another question.

He still couldn't answer well.

He's asked to re-apply after watching more movies.

He'll probably have more to say.

Thinks the interviewer.

He now has four people who told him to watch English movies.

He goes on the internet.

People keep saying to watch English movies.

Except Kevin.

Of the small website.

Call Center Training Tips.

Kevin must be stupid.

But he has [hundreds of screenshots of messages of people hired because they followed his advice](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/testimonials).

He still can't believe it.

Kevin posted that it was a bad idea to depend on English Movies to qualify for call center work.

Everyone on the call center group bashed him.

But they can't give a better solution.

They just insist that I should watch English movies.

Everyone says watching as English movies as a kid improved their English.

But I am not a kid.

I'm an adult.

Maybe it works if you're young.

Am I too old to learn?

Is it too late for me?

Kevin claims there's a better way.

I don't remember exactly what Kevin said.

Something about writing activities.

I hate writing.

I graduated from college and I always hated writing activities.

I should be done by that by now.

Writing is just for students.

I need something more practical.

I guess I'll just watch more movies.

Harry Potter.

Twilight.

The new Lord of the Rings and Star Wars movies.


The story continues.

I'm still unemployed.

But I enjoyed the movies.

Thank you for reading my story.
