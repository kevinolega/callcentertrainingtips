Many people are stuck with their writing.

Some people are frustrated composing sentences and quit on themselves wheneever this happens.

The first major step in my lessons is I teach my students to discontinue writing paragraphs and long sentences when composing their thoughts.

I also limit the topics to writing stories about themselves.

Just write about yourself.

Write about your life experiences.

Write about what you know.

Write short simple sentences.

### LONG SENTENCE EXAMPLE:

I spend my free time writing, cooking, and going to the gym.

### ### INSTRUCTIONS:

You need to shorten the sentence.

You need to separate the ideas.

### SHORTENED SENTENCE EXAMPLE 1:

I spend my free time writing.

I spend my free time cooking.

I spend my free time going to the gym.

### EXPLANATION:

I didn't add new words.

I just gave each idea its own sentence.

You can be creative and make the following changes.

### SHORTENED SENTENCE EXAMPLE 2:

I spend my free time writing.

I love cooking.

I enjoy going to the gym.
