Transliteration is not what you think it is.

I've heard the word transliteration from BPO workers and instructors.

When BPO workers (and ex-BPO workers) say Transliteration:

They mean:

Filipinos attempt to translate their ideas from Filipino to English word-for-word resulting in a poor translation.

FOR EXAMPLE:

The problem was brought to my face.

Pinamukha sa akin ang problema.

I Googled transliteration and transliteration English Filipino.

I couldn't find anything on it.

This is what transliteration means.

Transliteration is the process of transferring a word from the alphabet of one language to another. 

Transliteration helps people pronounce words and names in foreign languages.


I guess the call cener folk that use Transliteration mean:

Poor translation resulting from literal translation.
