I remember listening to a lecture. The teacher said, there’s value in the truth. 

The problem is not that things are expensive. 

The truth is that YOU CAN’T AFFORD something. 

The problem is not the standard is too high. 

The truth is YOU ARE TOO STUPID. 

The problem is not that the teacher was strict. 

The truth is that YOU DID NOT STUDY. 

The problem is not the boss is too judgemental. 

The truth is YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG. 

The problem is not the job is hard. 

The truth is YOUR ARROGANT ATTITUDE got you fired. 

There are two ways to see the world. 

First is that the world is the problem. 

Second is that I AM THE PROBLEM. 

Now here's the lesson...

It's seven billion times easier to fix one person than to fix the world. 

If that person is yourself, you have the opportunity to change. 

If that person is someone else, good luck with that.
