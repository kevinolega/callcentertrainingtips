The most common complain that I receive is from visitors is...

### Here's my take...

I was eighteen when I started.

I failed so many times and I feel horrible too.

But what I said next is different.

I failed so many times...

I'm not there yet.

But I've learned so many valuable lessons.

And I'm confident that I'm smarter today than the me who failed yesterday.

I can answer questions more intelligently because I know from experience what works and what doesn't work.

I'm better because don't have ideas but I have experience.

I couldn't make the interviewer smile yesterday but I;'m sure that I can today.

I didn't know how to introduce myself effectively yesterday but I can today.

I didn't ask questions yesterday but I will today.

I said a few words incorrectly yesterday but I know how to say it right today.

I forgot the formula for a math problem and didn't know the answer yesterday but I Googled it already and I know how to solve this today.

I realized that the way I am presenting myself isn't too professional yesterday but I fixed it already.

I've learned.

I've grown.

My failure.

Is my asset.

And the reason...

For my success.
