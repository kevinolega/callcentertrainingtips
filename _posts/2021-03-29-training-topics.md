We designed our program to help our you become comfortable speaking English during interviews and everyday conversations.

We use writing exercises to help you practice expressing your thoughts, discover your grammar problems, and reveal your deficiencies.

We conduct a phone coaching session to discuss corrections and give you advice on how to communicate more effectively.

The lessons help applicants prepare for BPO work, sales and supervisory roles.

The activities benefit almost any job.

You can confidently perform the following tasks after completing the exercises:

1. Introduce yourself.
2. Ask questions.
3. Give instructions.
4. Share stories.

We will always have an opportunity for Q&A during the phone coaching and email activities.
