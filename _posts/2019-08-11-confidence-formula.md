## Instructions:

Read this out loud.

Read this with feelings.

Read this before you begin your day.

Read this before you end your day.

GUARANTEE: If you read this everyday for ninety days, your life will experience a positive change.

Just like I did.

This can be found in the book Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill.

Some modifications have been made.

Buy the book when you get the change.

This also functions as a pronunciation assessment.

This has TH, B & V, P & F sounds.

If this assessment is too diffuclt for you, practice with [the interview mindset](http://callcentertrainingtips.com/interview-mind).

## First. 

I know that I have the ability to achieve the object of my Definite Purpose in life. 

Therefore, I DEMAND of myself persistent, continuous action toward its attainment. 

And I here and now promise to render such action.

## Second. 

I realize that the dominating thoughts of my mind will eventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical action. 

And gradually transform themselves into physical reality. 

Therefore, I will concentrate my thoughts for thirty minutes daily.

I will concentrate upon the task of thinking of the person I intend to become. 

Thereby, creating in my mind a clear mental picture.

## Third. 

I know through the principle of auto-suggestion. 

Any desire that I persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek expression through some practical means of attaining the object back of it. 

Therefore, I will devote ten minutes daily to demanding of myself the development of SELF-CONFIDENCE.

## Fourth. 

I have clearly written down a description of my DEFINITE CHIEF AIM in life. 

And I will never stop trying, until I have developed sufficient self-confidence for its attainment.

## Fifth. 

I fully realize that no wealth or position can long endure, unless built upon truth and justice. 

Therefore, I will engage in no transaction which does not benefit all whom it affects. 

I will succeed by attracting to myself the forces I wish to use, and the cooperation of other people. 

I will induce others to serve me, because of my willingness to serve others. 

I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism, by developing love for all humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. 

I will cause others to believe in me, because I will believe in them, and in myself.

I will sign my name to this formula. 

Commit it to memory. 

And repeat it aloud once a day. 

With full FAITH that it will gradually influence my THOUGHTS and ACTIONS so that I will become a self-reliant, and successful person.
