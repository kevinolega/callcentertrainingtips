This post is inspired by a conversation that I had with one of my students.

Are you aware that there's no safety net in VA work?

She said no.

Here's what happens in call center work.

In a call center if you're late or absent, you'll get fired.

Here's one important distinction.

The company will give you a couple of chances to change.

You will have a supervisor who will advise you and help you make progress with your improvement.

The call center company will pay you for your attendance.

Here's what happens if you're a freelancer.

In VA work, if you miss a shift, the same thing can happen.

The boss doesn't care if you lost your internet or your computer broke.

You are dealing with the client directly.

The client ALWAYS has the option to fire you immediately and not pay you at all.

Your freelance contract is not covered by any local labor agencies.

There's nobody to complain to or mediate about disagreements.

The employer has the option to not pay you anything even if you worked 29 days and you only messed up on day 30.

Did you know that this is the situation with VA work?

If not, I recommend that you get some more low-stakes practice in a call center environment.

1. You can use the salary to save money and buy better equipment.
2. You can develop the discipline to follow the work schedule religiously.
3. You can get more practice with dealing with Americans.
4. You get to build up your customer service and sales skills.

If you're weak at any of this, getting a freelance job can be tough.
