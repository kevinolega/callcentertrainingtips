My lessons have helped several Filipinos get hired in a call center.

Here are a few messages that I received.


I am grateful at the massive amount of testimonials that I receive from my readers.

I collect your messages.

I use your words to encourage myself on lazy days when I don't feel like working.

One free way you can do to support me is by sending me "good news."

I'd love to hear how my writing (or videos) has helped you in any way.

However, the amount of messages I have received has been using up lots of space in my server.

I later decided to move all my testimonials into a Google Photos Album.
