I'm not a good Facebook Friend.

DON'T ADD ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

I will call you on your bullshit.

If you are posting quotes but it's not a part of your life, I will tell you that you are speaking bullshit.

If you are blaming the world, I will tell you to blame yourself.

All your misfortunes are 100% YOUR FAULT!!!

ALL OF IT!!!

I can be a millionaire kaso mabait ako.

I can be a millionaire kaso I help my family.

Nope.

Nope.

Nope.

Let's speak the truth.

I can be a millionaire but I spend dozens of hours watching pirated movies and TV shows.

I can be a millionaire but I already gave all my investment money to San Miguel Corporation and Phillip Morris Philippines.

I can be a millionaire but I don't own any Facebook stock and I am using my work hours helping Facebook grow their business for free.

I can be a millionaire but all my time is invested in entertainment and gaming companies.

I can be a millionaire but I'm putting all my money in Sangyupsal places and milk tea.

I can be a millionaire but Anime and K-Drama is life.

The truth is. I am helping other people become millionaire and I am making my family poor and I am making my future SELF POOR!

Parang ABS CBN shows lang.

Kung saan yung mga mahirap lang yung bida.

Hindi ka po bida pag mahirap ka.

Kailangan mo umasenso.

You need to be intelligent.

Kaya ka nga pinag-aaral ng magulang mo.

Kaso mukhang nasayang lang pera nila sayo.

Just so you know.

8k/payout for 5 years is 1 Million Pesos.

So if you earn, 25k-30k/month, kayang kaya in less than 5 years.

That's not a giant number.

But the question is kaya mo ba humindi sa distraction?

Kaya mo ba humindi sa inuman ng tropa mo?

Kaya mo ba alagaan yung sarili mo para hindi ka magkasakit?

Kaya mo ba i-maintain disciplina mo?

I ❤️ you guys!!!
