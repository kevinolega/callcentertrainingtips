One of my mentors is a senior vice president of a giant company in the Philippines.

He gave me his personal email address.

I asked for and received his advice dozens of times but only ended up emailing him once.

I also only met him a few times.

Whenever I'm stuck with a problem and need help, I take the time to write a good description of my problem.

I do my best to include all the important details so they have context of my situation.

I write down my questions on the email.

I write down the different outcomes that I want to happen.

When my email gets to a full page, I pare down the email and remove the repetitive words.

Then I leave the email in my drafts.

The next day, I try to imagine what they'll tell me.

Then I go back and update the email further.

I take as many steps as I can in writing the email want to make sure that the message is clear.

I also try to judge my message based on what I know about my mentor's usual answers and personal philosophy.

I repeat this process three or more times.

Eventually, the answer becomes clear for me and I realize I no longer neeed to bother for them with my question.

I usually end up thanking them for inspiring me.

Sometimes I include the shortest version of the dilemma, what I think their advice is, what I did and how it turned out.

Then I thank them for the help and their support.
