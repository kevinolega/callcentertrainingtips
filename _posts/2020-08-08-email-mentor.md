One of my mentors is a senior vice president of a giant company in the Philippines.

He gave me his personal email address.

I asked for and received his advice dozens of times but only ended up emailing him once.

I also only met him a few times.

Whenever I'm stuck with a problem and need help, I take the time to write a good description of my problem.

I do my best to include all the important details so he has context of my situation.

I write my questions on the email.

I write the different outcomes that I want to happen.

I pare down the email and remove the repetitive words when my email gets to a full page.

I then leave the email in my drafts.

The next day, I try to imagine what they'll tell me.

Then I go back and update the email further.

I sometimes find something my mentor said about my question in his blog or in my notes.

I take as many steps as I can in writing the email because I want to make sure that the message is clear.

I also try to judge my message based on what I know about my mentor's usual answers and personal philosophy.

I repeat this process three or more times.

Eventually, the answer becomes so clear to me.

I realize I no longer need to bother the mentor with my question.

I usually end up thanking them for inspiring me.

I sometimes include the shortest version of the dilemma, what I think their advice is, what I did and how it turned out.

I then thank them for the help and their support.
