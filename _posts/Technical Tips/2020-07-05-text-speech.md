After editing my writing, I read my writing aloud.

I usually read two or three times.

When I'm done, I quickly paste my writing to a Text to Speech reader, and listen to the automated voice read my writing.

If anything sounds, wrong or awkward, I would make the needed changes.

If the voice sounds natural, I am confident that my writing is ready to be published.
