I got this question from a reader:

Pano mo matutulongan si customer pag wala siya connection at dial tone sa telepono at pano siya makaka pag contact through hotline  natin?

No dial-tone.

How can she call us?

Most people use their mobile number as a back-up phone.

Alternatives would be web apps like Google Voice, Skype, or other services.

If the customer isn't tech-savvy, the simplest way is to call from a neighbor's landline.

**DISCLAIMER:**

Different companies have different spiels for different issues.

Some companies have strict talking points.

Some companies give you the freedom to make changes.

Consult your team leader before making changes to your spiel to help you stay out of trouble.

The version of this spiel is my own spiel.
