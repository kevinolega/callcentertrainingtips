I read the book Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill.

I had the opportunity to read this book when I was younger.

There's a part that said something about writing down the exact amount of money that you want to earn.

At different points in my life, I wrote down anywhere from twenty thousand a month to a hundred thousand a month.

There were times in my life where I earned less than my target.

My goal was 20k, and I only earned 6k.

I was eighteen.

There were times when I almost hit my target.

My goal was 100k, and I only earned 90k.

I was nineteen.

There were times when I hit more than my target.

My goal was 25k, and I earned 40k.

I was twenty-two.

There were times when the increase was an unexpected surprise.

My goal was to earn $400, and my client suddenly offered to pay me $1,000.

Almost every year, twice every year, I write down my target income in my journal.

I almost always hit something.

Let's go back to the book we're discussing.

After writing your target income, write down what you are willing to exchange for that income.

The book recommended charging money and serving people in the best way that I can.

Before we continue, I haven't read the book in a long time, so I'm just sharing this story from memory.

The better way to serve people is by being skillful, and this idea became part of my approach to life.

I spent my time learning skills.

I spent my time learning how to sell.

I spent my time learning how to make websites.

I spent my time learning how to market online.

I spent my time learning how to market in person.

I spent my time learning how to work in customer service.

I spent my time learning technical support.

I spent my time learning how to sell services.

I spent my time learning how to work from home.

I spent my time learning how to be more responsible.

I spent my time learning how to cook.

I spent my time learning how to take care of my health.

I spent my time learning how to write professionally.

I spent my time learning how to edit photos.

I spent my time learning how to edit videos.

I spent my time learning how to use Apple computers.

I spent my time learning how to use different tools and technologies.

I spent my time learning a lot more skills, but this post is getting too long.

In November of 2018, I got an 88,000 peso job offer from a US real estate digital marketing services company.

Some people might say that amount is a lot of money.

Some professionals and business owners will say, 88k a month is not a big deal.

For someone who started his first job earning 6k a month, that's substantial growth in 16 years.

That's fourteen times my original income.

I did my best to learn two or three new skills a year.

Some years, I only learned one new skill.

I'm excited to discover how much more I can earn as I learn more skills.

#### What's Next?

Write down your income goals.

How much money do you want to earn monthly?

Write down the skills that you plan to learn to reach that income level.

What skills are you going to learn?
