Medicine tastes bitter.

Exercise is always preceded by a feeling of laziness.

Eating right and sleeping right is difficult too because there's always some asshole trying to poision you with garbage junk food and San Miguel Beer.

Family always requires work and is never effortless.

Relationships are scary because of rejections and you are always at risk of being misunderstood.

Getting a job is hard.

Getting a sale is harder.

Keeping jobs are five times more difficult than finding jobs.

Running a business is always increasingly difficult.

Everything worth it in life is difficult.

The bigger the challenge, the bigger the reward.

If you want a good life for yourself and your family, you need to be brave.

If it's too much trouble for you, stick to low paying jobs.
