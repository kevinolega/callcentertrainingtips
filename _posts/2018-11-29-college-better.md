Recruiters and business owners prefer to hire college graduates over high school graduates for the following reasons.

## 1. Reads long hours. 

Most training materials are boring but if you finished college, you probably finished reading a lot of training materials.

## 2. Reads and follows instructions. 

If you graduated, it probably means that you know how to read and follow instructions.

## 3. Their communication skills have already been tested. 

You need to do reports, participate in discussions and defend your thesis.

## 4. Paid for education. 

They know that upgrades costs money and have a higher return. They paid for books and a class. 

## 5. They are expected to be punctual and professional, otherwise, they would fail college.


## 6. They are more intelligent overall.
