Failing is a good thing. 

Failure builds experience and makes you more knowledgeable. 

When you're knowledgeable enough, you become qualified for the job. 

When you become qualified, getting a job is easy. 

When you have a job, getting money is easy. 

When you have money, getting more friends and family na mangungitang is easy. 

Confront your weakness and stay in touch.
