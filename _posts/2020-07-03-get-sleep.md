When you find yourself in a situation when you're not performing well, get enough sleep.

Lack of sleep is the reason for poor performance almost everywhere.

When I lack sleep, I perform poorly at work.

When I have enough sleep, I perform well at work.

When I lack sleep, I'm weak at the gym.

When I have enough sleep, I can lift 365 lbs.

When I lack sleep, I don't have discipline.

When I have lots of sleep, my body follows all my commands.

When I lack sleep, I don't follow my diet.

When I have lots of sleep, I always eat healthily and can say no to junk food.

When I lack sleep, I let other people take advantage of me and push me around.

When I have enough sleep, I'm competent and ready for anything.

When I lack sleep, I make a lot of stupid decisions.

When I have a lot of sleep, I'm wise and unstoppable.

When I was younger, I used to sacrifice sleep because I felt I'm missing out on life.

Now that I'm older, I realized that I ruined my own life again and again simply because I sacrificed sleep.

Get enough sleep.

Get your life in order.
