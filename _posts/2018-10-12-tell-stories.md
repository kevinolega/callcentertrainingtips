Stories prove things without directly telling your interviewer what you want to say.

Your interviewer was not there and doesn't understand the context of your story.

Where did this story take place?

When did this story take place?

What was going on when this story took place?

Have a beginning, middle and end.

I remember a time when I was...

What was the problem?

What is the consequence of not solving the problem? 

What are the stakes?

What were your emotions and fears?

How did you get to a solution?

Who helped you?

What did you do, how did you do it?

What did you feel while working on your solutions?

Are there cliff hangers?

Have Sample stories
