If I don't know the definition or pronunciation of a word, the first thing that I do is to Google its meaning.

If I'm not familiar with a term, I search first.

You can find most photos online.

You can find most how-to guides online.

You can find most recipes online.

The most brilliant minds and most talented people in the world share their knowledge on the internet.

The smartest people in the world are just one click away.

All you need to do is to type words on your computer.

All you need to do is to key in a few words on your phone.

Almost anything that you need to know can be learned.

You can find text.

You can find infographics.

You can find audio.

You can find video presentations.

There's no excuse for ignorance in this day and age.

I even got to listen to Harvard Lectures and virtually sit in at Law School classes.

Here's the thing. 

When someone asks you a question that you don't know the answer to, you're allowed to say, "I don't know."

But don't stop with "I don't know."

Instead, say, "I don't know. Please give me a couple of minutes. I'll just check."

Pull out your phone and start searching.
