## What kind of computer skills are required in a call center?

Computer skills are important.

Computer skills are a basic skill in modern life.

I talk to a lot of people who tell me they aren’t computer literate or have no computer skills.

I found the opposite to be true after asking further questions.

So instead of writing about the required call center computer skills, I’ll just ask you a few questions to determine your computer skill level.

Do you own a social media account like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, or Tiktok?

Do you own a computerized resume?

Did you type your resume on a computer?

Do you check your email?

Have you purchased anything online?

Do you know how to shut down a computer?

Do you know how to search for things on Google?

Do you know how to save your files on a USB flash drive?

Do you know how to attach files or photos to your email?

Is your answer yes to all of these questions?

Congratulations, you are computer literate.

You’re knowledgeable about computers.

I’m not playing with you.

These are the minimum tasks that you need to know about computers.

### Is your answer yes to most of these questions?

Copy the questions into Google search and spend a few minutes reading up on the task.

Videos on how to do almost anything is available on YouTube.

### Is your answer no to all of these questions?

I recommend the same solution.

Copy the questions into Google search and spend a few minutes reading up on the task.

Videos on how to do almost anything is available on YouTube.

Go through all the questions.

Write notes.

## REQUIRED CALL CENTER TYPING SPEED

Some companies will require that you can type around 20-30 words per minute (sometimes more), but typing skills can be developed.

Free typing games are available to help you.

Search for free typing games or typing tests.

I prefer typing games over serious typing tests.

You can also increase your typing speed if you write for a website.

I now have a typing speed of close to 40 words-per-minute because I want to type faster so I can just type my thoughts on the website post as if I were just dictating it.

Developing speed does take some time, though.

A higher typing speed is not required but having the faster typing speed makes your life easier.

## WHERE DOES FEAR OF COMPUTERS COME FROM?

Some people are just too lazy to learn and eventually make excuses.

The other honest mistake is that they believe that someone who’s good with computers is someone who can tear open a computer and put everything back together or do programming, hacking, or other stuff like that.

Call center companies don’t need advanced computer skills.

You don’t need to be a programmer, computer Engineer, or hacker to work in a call center.

Call center companies need someone who can answer the phone and type in some information on the computer.

Call center agents need you to know basic information like where the keys are on the keyboard.

You’ll need to know keyboard shortcuts like copying, pasting, undo, redo, and select all.

## BASIC WINDOWS SHORTCUTS

In case you don’t know yet:

Ctrl+C = Copy
Ctrl+V = Paste
Ctrl+Z = Undo
Ctrl+Y = Redo
Ctrl+A = Select all
Ctrl+F =Find/Search

Do you understand basic computer skills?

Good.
