Send PDF’s when you attach or email your resume.

You should send your resume as a PDF instead of a word document.

PDF’s follow a standard format and is perfect for sending your resume.

PDF’s are also difficult to edit giving your document added security.

I recommend that you convert your resume from Google Docs into a PDF.

Upload the PDF back into Google Drive.

Share the file to the recruiter you are coordinating with.
