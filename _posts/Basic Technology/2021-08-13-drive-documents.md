## GOOGLE DOCUMENTS

We don’t use Microsoft Office anymore.

We use Google Documents to send a resume.

Google Docs is free to use and available online.

You don’t need to download or install Google Docs on your computer.

You may install the Google Docs app on your mobile device.

You already have Google Docs if you have a Gmail account.

Here’s what you need to know about Google Docs.

Google Docs is like Microsoft Word.

Google Spreadsheet is like Microsoft Excel.

Google Slides is like Microsoft Powerpoint.

Google Drive is the online backup where everything is stored.

Just go to drive.google.com and start making documents.
