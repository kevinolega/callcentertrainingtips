I want you to become familliar with these tools so you can increase the level of your computer skills.

Please use these tools to submit your answers to the writing exercises if you are a coaching student.

## GOOGLE DRIVE

Google drive is a free online storage service from Google.

You can use it to back-up, store, and share files online.

Google Drive is free if you have your own Google account.

If you have an email address that ends in @gmail.com then you have free Google drive with your accounts.

We don’t use Microsoft Office anymore.

We use Google Documents to send a resume.

Google Docs is free to use and available online.

You don’t need to download or install Google Docs on your computer.

You may install the Google Docs app on your mobile device.

You already have Google Docs if you have a Gmail account.

Here’s what you need to know about Google Docs.

Google Docs is like Microsoft Word.
