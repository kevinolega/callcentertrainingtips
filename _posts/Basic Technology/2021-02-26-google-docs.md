I recommend that you submit your answers using Google Docs.

I'll be able to give better feedback on Google Docs because it has a comments and suggestion feature.

I can write corrections directly on the file.

Please share your answers with callcentertrainingtips@gmail.com

If you have a Gmail account, you already have Google Docs. 

Just head over to [https://drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com) and create a new document.

If you're using a mobile device, Google Docs is available on both [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-docs-sync-edit-share/id842842640) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.docs&hl=en&gl=US).

I recorded a short guide:

Please write your answers on the Google Document.
