Professional communication is done via email.

Recruiters judge your tech skills by what kind of email address you use.

If your email is Yahoo or Hotmail, they assume you’re old and not very tech-savvy.

If your email is a Gmail or iCloud, they’ll assume you have some technical knowledge.

If your email is from your own website, they’ll assume you are an expert.

You’ll need to put your email on your resume if you apply for a BPO job or an office job.

You’ll need to put your Skype account if you apply for “work from home opportunities.”

If you’re interested in online freelance work, you’ll also need to understand Slack, Zoom, Trello, Asana, Basecamp, and ZenDesk.
