Try checking Google Maps first if you’re looking for a place.

The first option is to type the address.

Sometimes you don’t know the exact address.

Try searching for the landmark.

If you’re having difficulty, you can try pinpointing the location on the map.

Apps like Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze can help you find your way around the city.

Use these apps to never get lost. 

Advanced features include commute directions, travel time prediction, and recommend the best time to leave.

Study these features, and you’ll navigate better.
