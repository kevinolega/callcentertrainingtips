I may sound contradictory.

Different situations require different tools.

Many advice and strategies work for specific situations.

The important detail to remember is it doesn't work in other situations.

You want to gain experience so you know what strategy or tool works with what situations.

In some situations, you want to save as much money as possible.

In other situations, you want to spend as much money as possible.

In some situations, you need to be quiet.

In some situations, you need to keep talking.

In some situations you need to ask questions.

In some situations you need to answer questions.

In a lot of situations, if something doesn't work, the answer is the opposite.

If that doesn't work, the answer is trying something else.

In some situations, it's studying what you've already tried, and looking for what needs to be adjusted.

There are a few good recipes in life.

In a lot of cases, the recipe needs to be adjusted depending on the situation.

The tools may be different.

The weather may be different.

The thing you're cooking may be different.

The amount of ingredients that you have may be different.

Adjust your strategy to match the situation.
