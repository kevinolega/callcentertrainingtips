Make a list of Call Center companies that you want to apply in.

Having a list will allow you to move forward.

Because you know that you have somewhere to go next, any rejection you experience will be a LOT less painful.

One of the biggest problems of job applicants is waking up and not knowing where to go to or apply in that day.

99% of the time, not knowing where to go is the reason why many people don't get hired in a call center.

The biggest consequence of not having a list is you waste your day.

If you waste enough days, you will lose your opportunity.

No list means you are also steadily losing confidence, money, motivation and you'll become a bum or you'll settle for a low paying job.

Your family deserves better.

You deserve better.

You are worth it!

Having a list is like having a map.

A list is a very basic plan but it will help you stay on track.

Having names of companies you haven't visited yet, gives you hope and helps you recover from any failure you experience faster.

Having poorly writtien plan is way better than living your life with no plan at all.

So make a list of call center companies that you want to apply in then visit each company one by one until you get the best job that you can take with your current skill level.

What are you waiting for?

Do it now!
