Please read my post carefully before behaving like a snowflake.

You're free to disagree but please read past the title to understand the context of the post that you are commenting on.

My posts aren't meant to gaslight.

I built my life around the money that I earned and the skills that I learned while working in a call center.

The goal of the post is to educate people about potential obstacles faced by new call center agents.

Negative experiences exist.

The question is whether to quit or not despite the obstacles.

Choosing to persevere requires growing up as a person.

I've been interviewing friends for many years.

The circumstances are identical.

30 people in a training batch.

3 survivors after the first year.

20 people in a training batch.

2 survivors after the first year.

We consistently face people who borrow money, invite us to drinking sessions, and skipping work.

We're always fighting peer pressure from friends, family, and marketing.

I don't try to dissuade people to work in the BPO industry.

The message of the post is to get people to choose with their "eyes open" instead of blind hope or faith.


Call center work is the best industry to work in for people who are ambitious and lack the resources to jump toward their dream job.

The objective of my posts is to point out the obstacles because it's not sunshine and rainbows working in a call center.

90% of the training batch gets eliminated within the first year.

Many people come in expecting the job to be easy.

Call center haters believe that call center work is for the unintelligent.

I outlined the kind of challenges and obstacles that we face.

I present a choice at the end:

Write down the following on your journal:

Call center work can be done by anyone.

But not everyone can work in a call center.

Call center work is a high-paying job that requires me to be physically, emotionally and mentally disciplined.

Call center work is an opportunity with a personal cost.

QUESTIONS TO PONDER:

Am I willing to change myself to get the job?

What areas of my life do I need to work on so I will qualify for call center work?

The questions are in line with the core message of this group.

Are you ready to grow up and accept responsibility?
