In this video, we talked about how to tell stories about our strengths, weakness, success and failures and connect them to make the interviewers want to hire us.

Then we proceed to the pronunciation activity.

We discuss the most common pronunciation errors.

We focus on the top 100 most used words in the English language.

We practice pronouncing the numbers 1 to 100.

Some of the dead air, long pauses and my dog barking have been edited out.

I was trying to shorten the video.

I'm not perfect.

I still make mistakes.

I say "so" a lot.

I say "uhmm" a lot.

I'm still trying to improve.

Hopefully in the next sessions, I can cut down these fillers.

At the end of the video, we discuss Wherlyn's favorite lessons from her first two weeks of practicing with us.
