I wrote tips in this site to help a few friends look for work in a call center. Later on more people asked me for tips. Instead of explaining things to them one by one I decided it would be better if I put the advice in writing and answered questions on this site. I don’t claim to have all the answers but I believe I have a few that could help. I believe in your ability that’s why I don’t spoon feed you all the time and I’m asking you to take action and tell me as soon as you get hired. If you were to ask me how to get hired in a call center here are the ten usual tips I give my friends:

### 1\. Print thirty copies of your resume.

The application process is a process. You will win some and lose some. That’s part of it. Have several copies of your resume to remind yourself that it takes several attempts to land a job. An interview is like a first date. That said you don’t want to marry your first date. You have to go look for a match. You also have to get to several ones before you find your regular date and the one you’ll eventually partner up with. On a lighter note, you have no right to complain until after you have used up all thirty copies of your resume.

### 2\. Identify ten call centers that you would like to work for.

People don’t plan to fail. They fail because they fail to plan. The biggest time waster is not knowing what to do and trying to decide as you’re about to do it. Decide now where you want to go and then act. So when you’re applying if they say no you can go to the next quickly. In my experience the more companies I have as prospects the more at ease I am at interviews because I know that if this interview does not go well I have many companies lined up and waiting for me.

### 3\. Apply via walk in application.

Feel free to apply online. I like this step because I like being in control of my schedule. If things don’t go well with my interview I walk in to the nearest one I know of. Walking in is more convenient. I just go there and submit my resume and get processed there and then at my convenient time. I am never late because they are not expecting me anyway. There are more. Just give it a shot. Who knows? By your walk in application your interviewer might be pleasantly surprised.

### 4\. Know yourself.

I’m me and you’re you so there’s no point in trying to be me just to get a job. I believe you have something great to offer. Make a list of your accomplishments, things you’re proud of, recent compliments etc. Knowing these in advance before they ask you can give you a better answer when needing to answer the question “Why should I hire you?”

### 5\. Know how to answer questions.

I don’t recommend memorizing answers but I do recommend knowing your answers in advance. Be creative and unforgettable. I wrote some examples on how to answer call center interview questions here. Requiters are human. They are harmless but just as girls don’t fall for cheesy pick up lines as they do in the movies memorized interview answers don’t work and describes you in one word. Phony.

### 6\. Be confident.

When you know yourself and you know why they should hire you then confidence will come out. Confidence affects skill level so make sure it’s high and your performance level will be high as well.

### 7\. Speak in English.

They are hiring you because of your ability to solve problems and speak well in English. I know that you can do it. Just practice. Need additional help?

### 8\. Learn from your experience.

Sometimes getting hired is like a puzzle you need to learn to solve. If things don’t go well maybe you don’t have all the pieces you need to win and that’s okay. Learn and pick up better tools as you move forward. Eventually you’ll get it and looking for work will be effortless.

### 9\. Smile and give it your best shot.

A smile can be heard over the phone. A smile shows confidence. A smile puts the other person at ease. A smile feels good and puts you at ease. A smile starts bonds. A smile is proof of having a bond. A smile can help you because I can’t teach you how to give your best shot. All I know is I don’t have to convince you to smile. In my experience my best shot starts with a smile.

### 10\. Enjoy it.

Make it a game and you’ll have fun. Want to win but don’t be afraid of losing. Conquer defeat by taking more shots. Make friends. Learn and when you get hired earn. When you do send me a can of beer or wine or whatever. I’m looking forward to congratulating you. Thank you for reading. Let me know about your experience in the comments below. Have questions?
