I grew up playing Half-life, Counter-Strike, Diablo, and Starcraft.

When you die in the game, your friends called you bobo.

Bobo means stupid.

Bobo is a reminder that you did something wrong.

Bobo is a declaration that you can do better.

Bobo is a signal.

When you hear bobo, you focus.

You put your phone on silent mode.

You drown yourself in your favorite music.

You put your 100% into the game.

You follow the best strategies.

You pull out your best moves.

Sometimes you'd win.

Sometimes your player still dies, but it was a meaningful death.

When the other players say "good game," they actually mean what they said.

It was a good game.

The newer games like DoTA, LOL, ML, ROS, and PUBG have stronger teamwork requirements.

I find it interesting that even casual gamers have begun to mirror professional athletes' attitudes when they play.

They always try to beat their past performance.

If a teammate carelessly loses, the rest of the team loses.

During the more competitive games, you hear the word bobo more often.

They also scream bobo with more emotion.

Players use the word bobo to remind their teammates to focus.

Players use the word bobo to encourage their teammates.

We have high expectations because we believe in them.

We scream "bobo galingan mo."

Gamers are used to being called bobo.

That's why we make great people to hire.

We react positively to negative words.

Some people find the words bobo incredibly offensive.

Gamers just smile and play better.

If you're a gamer, you know exactly what I mean.

**Notes:**

Any word can have a positive meaning or negative meaning.

The effect of the person depends on the person.
