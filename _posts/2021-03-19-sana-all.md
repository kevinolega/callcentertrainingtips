I'm not sorry.

This is true.

You'll probably hate me for saying this.

I only hear losers say "sana all."

I never hear anybody successful muttering "sana all."

Please stop saying "sana all."

Saying "sana all" is never going to make your life better.

Do the work.

Teach yourself the needed skills.

Study your beliefs.

Fix your beliefs.

Never say "sana all."

Qualify for good jobs.

Deserve success.

Stop saying "sana all."

Otherwise, hardworking people will look down on you.
