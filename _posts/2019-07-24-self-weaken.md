Sometimes your problem is that you are not doing what you should be doing.

Like not practicing, not asking questions, not writing notes or not applying because you're afraid.

Sometimes your problem is you are doing things that are making you weaker.

Like not getting enough sleep, eating junk food, smoking, drinking alcohol, worrying too much, thinking negatively or dwelling on your failures.

It's not just what you do that will make you successful.

It's also about what you stop doing.

Stop doing things that will make you weak.

Stop being a pussy and start taking responsibility for your life. 

If you want it, you’ll find a way. 

If you don’t want it you’ll give an excuse.
