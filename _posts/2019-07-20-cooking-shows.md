A client told me I give really good instructions. 

I got it from watching cooking shows on YouTube. 

Watching cooking shows taught me to give step by step instructions. 

Many of these chefs are teaching their skills.

They give step by step instructions.

They give you an overview before they begin.

They prepared the steps and instructions. 

They're not just making things up as they go along.

Neither should you.

They pause at every step and share many important details.

They tell you what they're doing.

They tell you why they're doing the steps. 

Here are examples of my favorite cooking lessons.

## Gordon Ramsay's Steak and Eggs
