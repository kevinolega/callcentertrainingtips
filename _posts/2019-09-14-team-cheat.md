In school, they teach us that cheating is bad.

Losers call people who play well with their bosses sipsip (asskisser).

We have TV shows that treat solo players like celebrities.

But that is simply not true.

Every top performer....

In every field...

That gets paid...

A LOT OF MONEY...

Didn't get to the top ALONE.

Chef's have a full team of cooks in a restaurant slicing garlic and onions for them.

Businessmen build wealth because they have employees who contribute time, investors who contribute money and customers who support the business.

Manny Pacquao has a coach, manager, nutritionist, sparring partners and more.

Successful musicians have managers, promoters and other forms of help.

If your goal is to win as your own...

My question to you is...

Do you want BIG SUCCESS or small success?

Do you want to be a fishball vendor or a real entrepreneur.

The biggest games are played by teams.

Solo players are either killed or ignored because they're so small.

If you ever played DOTA or ML, you should know by now that SOLO players are killed easily because they are POWERLESS.

Even Jesus had a team.

Then you want to go alone?

Here's my question for you...

How big is your team?

Who is helping you?

Who is guiding you?

How competent are people in your team?

Do you have people smarter than you?

Do you have someone who achieved your goal already and is helping you out?

Is your family on your team?

Are your friends on your team?

Maybe that's your problem.

You fail because you are playing on your own.

And you expect to win on your own.

What do you call a person who is trying to win the NBA alone?

Crazy, right?

How do you build a team?

1. Follow good advice.

2. Make a contribution.

3. Pay your team well.

## Activity

Do a check. Write these question on your journal and try to answer. 

If you don't know the answer, discuss these questions with someone and ask for their help with the answers.

Are you trying to win on your own?

Who is on your team?

Who do you need to get on your team?

Who can you pay to help you succeed?
