I live in Sucat Para√±aque.

I also lived with family members in Alabang area.

When I was younger, I took jobs at SM Fairview, Quezon City and Ortigas area.

Everyday was a four to five hour commute going to work and going home.

I used to sleep during the long commutes.

During the bus rides.

When I got my paycheck, I started buying the Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice.

When I finished reading that, I bought the books my boss recommended that I buy.

My first books included:

Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill.

How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie.

Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki.

CashFlow Quadrant by Robert Kiyosaki.

Becoming a Person of Influence by John Maxwell.

Secrets of the Millionaire Mind by T Harv Eker.

The One Minute Manager by TK.

The NIV translation of the Bible.

Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi.

I ended up buying a dozen more sales books.

I read all these books on the bus.

I don't like highlighting or writing on books so I wrote interesting ideas onto a small blue notebook that I always carried around with me.

If you saw me on the bus, it's like I'm always studying for an exam.

I didn't do too well in school.

You may say that I'm a dropout.

But after I left school, I studied like a serious student.

That's because I'm afraid.

I don't want to become a loser for the rest of my life.

And I've seen people who reach 40 and 50 and they never held a decent job.

These people had no self respect.

Nobody looked up to them.

Nobody respected them.

I don't want to end up like that.

I'm already a failure at school.

I can't allow myself to be a failure in real life.

A typical college graduate has 16 years of education and graduate at 20 years old.

If I started studying seriously at 18 years old I'll catch up to them eventually.

Most people stop studying after they leave school.

I'm the opposite.

That's my opportunity.

When I got an MP3 player, my friends shared with me copies of their audiobooks and recorded seminars.

I listened to it all the time.

When I got my Apple iPod touch, I filled it with eBooks, audiobooks, seminars and podcasts.

When I got my first credit card, I bought eBooks from Kindle and audiobooks from Audible.

When I look around the bus, everyone's watching movies, TV shows, playing games and scrolling social media.

Fifteen years later, I discovered from my American friend that when he went to India and China, many people are continuing their education during their commutes.

Several people recommended that I invest 10% of my income into investments.

Instead, I invested my income into knowldege and my income increased.

You have two options on how you spend your extra time.

You can entertain yourself.

You can educate yourself.

There's no right answer.

It all depends on what kind of future you want to build.
