Just so you know, the title of the book that I'm writing is [PRACTICAL CALL CENTER JOB HUNTING STRATEGIES](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/books).

The information about the book is posted two lines below the title.

A call center hater won't waste time writing a book with the title [PRACTICAL CALL CENTER JOB HUNTING STRATEGIES](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/books).

BEFORE YOU BEGIN READING:

I feel bad for having to write this intro at the beginning.

I intended for my readers to understand the point of my message at the end.

I've encountered a couple of negative comments from people who didn't read past the title.

The post was just dismissed as a call center hater post.

My original post now has a call to action message to get me banned from this group.

As a result, the suspense has been removed, and the spoilers are now at the beginning of the post.

Many people go to call center companies expecting the job to be easy.

Haters of call center agents believe that call center work is for the unintelligent.

I am now unfortunately bundled into the "call center agent/industry haters tribe" because of a deficiency in reading comprehension.

The ideas in my post aren't intended to gaslight.

I built my life around the money that I earned and the skills that I learned while working in a call center.

My post is written to educate people about potential obstacles faced by new call center agents.

Life is not all sunshine and rainbows.

My post is an exploration of the negatives because I want you to make your decisions with your eyes open.

If you've read any of my other posts, you probably already figured out that I advocate against blindly doing anything.

Negative experiences exist.

You will ask yourself daily if you'd like to continue or quit when you face obstacles.

Choosing to persevere requires that you grow up as a person.

Here are my final points in the post.

I present the reader with a choice at the end.

Write down the following in your journal:

Call center work can be done by anyone but not everyone can work in a call center.

Call center work is a high-paying job that requires me to be physically, emotionally, and mentally disciplined.

Call center work is an opportunity with a personal cost.

QUESTIONS TO PONDER:

Am I willing to change myself to get the job?

What areas of my life do I need to work on so I will qualify for call center work?

The question that I asked are in line with the core message of this group.

Are you ready to grow up and accept responsibility?

Perseverance is a display of physical, mental, and emotional strength.

Growing up is the core message of the group Ready2Adult.
