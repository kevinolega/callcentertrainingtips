Hi there!

When you get the chance, visit the Call Center Training Tips Facebook Page.

Every day, I share lessons to help you get hired, regularized, and perform well in a call center.

I'll help you collect all the sweet, sweet call center money so you can improve yourself, your life and go after your true dream careers.

If you follow our page, we share these posts everyday:

1. Complete lessons - if you who only have free Facebook data (every 6am)

2. Short lessons - so you can upgrade your life little by little. Every challenge is a marathon, not a sprint. And we can get far if we go together. 

3. Free Training Videos - If you have internet access, you can watch me discuss all the lessons in detail.

4. Motivational Photos - I am sharing quotes and short lessons that improved my life. I'll share how I applied it and my personal experience. Sometimes it only takes a few lessons to make yourself successful stay tuned.

5. Free email lessons - If you give me your email address, I'll send you my best lessons, opportunities and announcements that I don't normally share on social media or my website. 

6. I also share really specific tips on how to learn faster, how to improve your personal life, how to quit bad habits, what good habits will improve your life, training tips, and more.

This is my main form of community service. 

We are not sponsored by the Philippine government or any company.

Everything on my Facebook page, my website, and my YouTube channel is 100% free.

I also have readers who support me by buying personal training sessions and email lessons.

For non-call center agents who are looking for work, I send specific lessons on how to prepare for your job application, and how to pass interviews, you'll also get three personal training sessions with me over the phone/Skype:

Php 250 (paid by bank deposit)

For call center agents who want to get regularized, become top agent, or increase your call center income from twenty to thirty thousand a month or more:

Php 500 (per month paid by bank deposit, you get weekly calls and lessons on how to become effective at your job, build more professional skills, improve your life, and get your true goals)

These personal training sessions are done over the phone or we can meet if you live near me (Para√±aque and Muntinlupa area only).

I only have unlimited calls to Globe, Skype and Landline (Metro Manila only). So if you don't have any of these, you can buy a Globe sim card for a hundred pesos or so, or borrow for a friend during our scheduled training sessions. 

Please show your support by hitting like, leaving a comment and sharing our lessons to the people you want to help.

I can't do this without you.

Help me reach more people.

If you have any questions, just send me a message.

Thank you for your continuous support.

I love you guys!

Kevin
