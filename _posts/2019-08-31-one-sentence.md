I believe that using one sentence paragraphs will improve your communication skill as it did mine.

I realized last year that if I keep my paragraph size to one sentences, writing becomes 1,000 times easier.

So I use a one sentence paragraph all the time.

I keep my writing with one sentence paragraphs.

It makes writing easier.

I write one sentence per line.

Then I edit.

Does the sentence make sense?

Does the sentence sound good?

Does the sentence sound the same way that I talk?

Can I make the sentence shorter?

Are there words that I can remove?

Are there technical terms that I can simplify or explain in a simple way?

Have I removed the following vague or unspecific words?

- This (use the spefic thing you are referring to)
- That (use the spefic thing you are referring to)
- Them (use the spefic person you are referring to)
- There (use the spefic place you are referring to)
- These (use the spefic items that you are referring to)
- It (use the spefic thing you are referring to)
- Something (use the spefic thing you are referring to)
- Someone (use the spefic person you are referring to)
- Other pronouns that make things unspecific.
- There are times where you can break these rules but most of the time, you can use the above rules and get good results.

You will benefit greatly from being as specific as possible.

That's because you end up not leaving anything to interpretation and be able to say exactly what you want to say.

One sentence paragraphs make it extremely easy for me find errors and fix.

I can easily compose.

If I'm writing on paper, one sentence parage  makes it easy for me to fix something.

If I'm writing on the computer, editing and moving text around becomes really easy. 

It also makes it easy to make a topic longer or shorter.

If I'm trying to understand a topic that I don't understand, I copy the article, lesson or message to a text editor and convert the text into a one text paragraph.

This is a practice that I've been doing to my newer lessons.

Adding space between the sentence.

This lesson is written in a one sentence paragraph format.

## Activity

Using a one sentence paragraph format, rewrite the following on your notebook:

- The story of your greatest accomplishment.
- The story of how to overcome your weakness.
- The story of how you learned your favorite skill.
- Instructions on how to use your favorite skill (For example cook your favorite food)
- Instructions on how to commute to a call center.
- Instructions on your advice on how to solve a problem.
- The story of why you wanted to work in a call center.
- What's your dream income and your plan to reach that dream income.
