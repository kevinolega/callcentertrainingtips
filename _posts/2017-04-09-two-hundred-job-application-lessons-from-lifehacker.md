Lifehacker is one of the blogs that permanrently changed my life.

I found it when I was looking for tips on how to organize my desk.

I read it for tools and tips on how to save time and how to be an all around awesome person.

Fiver of the most awesome people I have met in my life are regular lifehacker readers.

There are a lot of tips that will save you time and money and at the same time allow you to earn more money this year and instead of writing it all I decided to just put the links here.

You go read them yourself and let me know what worked for you.

I've been reading lifehacker since 2009 and over time, I had read a lot of the job hunting posts.

Here are some of my favorites.
