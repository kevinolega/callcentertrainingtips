I hope you're doing well.

We have a new module about Confident Conversations.

I have a feeling that you had a difficult time with the previous module.

We made the new module shorter.

You only need to write for a maximum of 30 minutes a day.

Every week, your total writing practice time can be an hour and forty five minutes to a maximum of three and a half hours.

You are also allowed to finish faster.

If you have more time, you can finish more writing exercises and complete the lessons in two weeks instead of six weeks.

Please send us a message if you'd like to enroll.
