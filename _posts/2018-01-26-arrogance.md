People who have no results are stuck where they are because of their arrogance.

They say things like "I know that already"

They are unwilling to learn.

You ask them to read something and they ignore you.

You give them advice and they disregard you.

You try to help them and they neglect you.

You say something they disagree with and they bash you.

You tell them to buy something and they doubt you.

In their mind they are always right.

My mentor always told me that you can be right or you can be rich but you can't be both.

Successful people learn from their mistakes.

Successful people are humble enough to accept where they are wrong and ask question that will guide them to good results.

Arrogant people are right all the time. 

In their mind so they never change and true enough their results never change.

When I was 19, my boss told me that rich people have money and poor people have pride.

I'm 32 now and I can say that this is true.

The people who need the most help are the people who are the most unwilling to do something to help themselves. 

The people who succeed are the people who are the most eager to learn.

This applies in a call center, in sales, in freelancing, in management,  any job position I've held. 

So what is more important to you in your life? 

Pride or success?

Only time will tell.

The answer is also in your wallet.
