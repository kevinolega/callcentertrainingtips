Solutions to some listening issues.

One of the issues with many new call center agents is listening.

After the new call center agent improve their speaking skills, they now realize that they need to work on their listening skills.

Sometimes we are not familiar with American accent so the details can be difficult to understand.

Some Americans talk too fast for beginners too comprehend.

This doesn't happen very often but some Americans speak in a totally alien accent to Filipinos.

I ask the trainer about the most common calls that we are going to receive.

Then I ask the trainer about the most difficult calls that we can expect.

I try to list down 20 of these calls.

What will the customer say to open these calls?

What will I say?

What are the common causes of these problems? 

What questions can I ask the customer to make sure I am dealing with the correct situation?

What are the possible solutions to this problem?

What is the best solution to the problem?

What is the fastest solution to the problem?

When you become familiar with the process, you know what to expect.

So even if you don't fully understand what the customer said, you can respond with intelligent questions and get a clearer picture of the situation.

So even when the line has issues, and you can't hear 100% of what the customer is saying, you can handle the call.

When you can't fully understand the customer, you can try to work with the customer first before offering to get their number and calling them back.

The first thing you can do is ask them about the issue.

I apologize, there seems to be an issue with the line. 

I'm unable to hear you fully.

Are you experiencing COMMON PROBLEM 1 or COMMON PROBLEM 2?

Then ask more probing questions.

If all else fails...

I want to make sure the issue gets resolved, may I have your phone number in case we get disconnected so I can call you back?

Then call the customer back and start over.
