You can escape your fear by admitting you're afraid.

This is one of my first few attempts to apply in a call center.

And I'm nervous because I'm worried about not getting hired.

But that shouldn't really stop me.

Because I'm sure that sooner or later I'll figure out exactly what I'm doing wrong.

And I'll get hired in a good company.

Then start your intro.

With that finally out of the way.

My name is Kevin.

I live in Para√±aque.

I used to work in sales.

And I wanted to work in a call center because I'm looking for higher pay.

And I know that reputable call center companies have good benefits.

And pay on time.

I spend my free time reading and writing and exploring the internet to learn new skills.
