Commitment is the exclusion of all other options.

## There are three levels of commitment:

- I'll try.
- I'll do my best.
- I'll do whatever it takes.

## When you try...

If something doesn't work, you give up.

When you try to get a job and you fail, you give up.

## When you do your best...

We actually have a song about that.

The most popular line starts...

I did my best...

But my best just wasn't...

Good enough...

And people give up.

What most people don't realize is that your best is not a fixed limit.

When I started weightlifting, I can lift a maximum of 130lbs.

In 2018, I could lift 365 lbs.

If you're committed, you'll do whatever it takes.

## When you do whatever it takes...

You still fail.

But you don't give up.

And you get better.

And that is where the magic happens.

When you come back as a better person.

You are qualified for opportunities.

Maybe you're only making a pronunciation mistake for a dozen words.

But after voluntarily facing your weakness, you already corrected eight and you now have only four to fix.

The interviewer laughs at the remaining four words.

But tells you how to properly pronounce it.

And lets you pass the final interview.

Losers give up.

Winners do whatever it takes.
