Filipino comedians are famous everywhere.

The top comedians in this category that I've listened to are Rex Navarette and Jokoy.

They make jokes based on how Filipinos sound when they try to speak English.

## When they hear Rex and Jokoy's impression of how Filipinos speak English...

Everybody laughs at these jokes, especially Filipinos.

That's because, as Filipinos, we understand that grammar and pronunciation are wrong.

We recognize this because we already have over ten years of English lessons back in school.

From first grade to sixth grade, we received English lessons about parts of speech and grammar rules.

We received the same lessons in our four years of high school.

That's why when we listen to incorrect English, we recognize it instantly.

Even if we don't recall the exact rule, we know in our hearts exactly what is wrong.

That's how ingrained the ten years of English lessons are in our character.

That's why we can watch English shows and understand the story without much effort.

If you read your writing aloud and listen to how it sounds, you'll notice all the mistakes.

All you need to do is listen, and you'll be able to correct errors on your own.
