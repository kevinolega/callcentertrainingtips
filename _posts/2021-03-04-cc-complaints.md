I don't ask strangers on social media what they think of a company.

99% of people quit call center work.

That said, 99% of the time, the feedback is always negative.

You'll hear the following complaints:

The work is too difficult.

The customers are toxic.

We have a sales quota.

The management is strict.

The team leader is an asshole.

There's powertripping and politics.

My wife had a fling in the call center during teambuilding.

These complaints happen everywhere.

These complaints should be ignored most of the time.

### Here are some legit complaints:

The salary is always delayed.

We often have disputes with the pay.

The company regularly asks us to work overtime and they don't pay us.

## The call center salary is too low!

Salary is a more comlex topic to navigate.

Is the salary close to minimum wage?

Are you working in an area that's paying provincial rate?

How far is the office from your location?

Are you comparing the job offer of a nearby location to a far away location?

How much money are you going to take home after commute and meal costs?

How does the salary compare to other companies in the area?

Do you have more than two years of call center experience speaking to American customers?

Salary is usually negotiable.

You have the option to transfer to another company if you're unhappy with the salary.

You have the option to decline a job offer if you're unhappy with the pay.

You may go to another company.

Sometimes the low pay is your only option.

There are situations when a small salary is better than earning zero.

Your decision should depend on your situation or salary.

I'm at a point where I don't accept job offers lower than â‚±30,000 a month.

I encourage you to plan your finances and careers carefully.

I sell a Financial Planning Module for call center agents.
