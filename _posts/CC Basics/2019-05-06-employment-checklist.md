When you look for work, aside from passing interviews and exams, you’ll need to submit some pre-employment requirements.

> 📦 This checklist is also part of the full guide: [Call Center Job Application & Interview](/call-center-job-application-interview/)


Pre-employment requirements are a common chore that needs to be done to finalize your job-hunting process.

Items in a pre-employment checklist are often standard for many call centers and most jobs I’ve accepted.

In case it’s your first time applying, or it’s your first time applying in a long time, here are some of the documents that you’d like to prepare in advance.
 
I took this list from a couple of my past employers.

I found some lists as I was sorting my paper documents.

Primary requirements are usually needed right after your hire date—often within the same week.

This list applies to most entry-level BPO jobs and pre-employment requirements in the Philippines.

## Pre-Employment Checklist for Call Center Applicants in the Philippines

Here’s a breakdown of the most common requirements you’ll need to submit before you can start training or begin work at your new call center job.


## THESE ARE CALL CENTER PRE-EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS IN THE PHILIPPINES.

**SSS Document E-1 / E-4 /E-6 dully received by SSS.**

Any printout that came from SSS and has their full name, SSS number and birthdate.

You can visit the SSS website to obtain this.

**TIN Document.**

Previous ITR/BIR 2316 or Stamped/Received BIR 1905/BIT 1902/ BIR2305.

You may visit BIR for more information.

**NBI Clearance (original copy).**

In many situations, you can get this same day and in other situations, the office will require you to return after three days or so.

I recommend paying the extra ₱100 or so to have your NBI clearance delivered. 

It will often cost you more than ₱200 if you go back to just pick it up.

**Police Clearance (original copy).**

Visit a nearby police station to obtain this. I got my police clearance at Parañaque City Hall.

I also got a police clearance ID for an extra hundred pesos or so.

**Medical Exam.**

Medical exams are often provided for free when you apply at reputable call centers and pass the screening process.

Just ask the HR for details.

Pick up your stool and urine container and enjoy the experience.

**Photocopy of ID’s.**

Include both front and back of your ID’s when you submit photocopies of your ID.

## Samples of Primary ID’s include:

* Unified or Digitized SSSID
* Drivers license.Should be current. By current, they mean not expired.
* Passport.Should be current. By current, they mean not expired.
* PRC ID.Should be current. By current, they mean not expired. Secondary ID’s include:
* Postal ID – I got mine at a post office and paid about ₱200 at the time.  
  As of 2020, the fee has increased to **₱550** for regular and **₱650** for rush applications.
* Voter’s ID.I don’t have one.
* TIN ID.I don’t have one.
* Philhealth ID with photo. Provided by my previous employer.
* Updated NBI Clearance. 

Turns out you can use your NBI clearance as an additional ID. Secondary pre-employment requirements are often needed before the end of training or before you start production work.

Samples of secondary Pre Employment requirements include.

- **Philhealth.** Just give a photocopy to your HR.
- **Marriage contract.** I don’t have one so just submit yours to HR.
- **Transcript of Records or Diploma.** Photocopy and give to HR.
- Loan Information (from SSS, Pagibig, or others).

Submit your information if you have any.

**Birth Certificate.**

I ordered mine online for 300 pesos I think.

Please visit the NSO website to order.

**Dependent’s Birth Certificate**

If you have the records on hand just submit.

Order from NSO if you need copies.

**Certificate of Employment.**

You can obtain this from the HR of your previous employer.

Tax Withheld Form/ITR.

For more information visit the BIR website.

**1x1 and 2x2 photos.**

I get my ID photos from Tronix all the time.

Photos costs less than ₱80 pesos and you can find Tronix at almost any SM or mall.

**BIR 1902 form** for TIN application.

You’ll need to speak to the HR if you still don’t have a TIN number so you can register online.

**BIR 1905 form** to transfer your records from your previous RDO to the current employer’s RDO. 

**BIR 2305 form** is needed to update your employer information and tax status.

## Some Notes:

When you look for work here are some requirements that you need to obtain and submit.

I would encourage you to review the list so you can review the cost or the amount you need to prepare for your job application.

I recommend getting a job offer before worrying about requirements.

I often save about  ₱3,000 extra on top of my job-hunting expenses to pay for requirements so I don’t get pressed for money whenever I need to switch jobs.

You’ll often be asked to undergo pre-employment medical examinations and the good call center companies will cover the expenses.

You will also need to secure your Philhealth MDR as well.

Requirements vary from company to company however these are the common minimum requirements.

Please inquire with your HR for more information.

## Failure Often Leads To:

Companies can cancel or withdraw the job offer.

Salary delays often resulting from a lack of requirements needed for ATM creation.

Termination if found negligent in complying with the requirements.
If you have questions just Google “how to get (insert requirement),” and you’ll find a site that has instructions. 

If you’ve ever taken a job with a company before, chances are you are already familiar with this process.

I wish you the best in your job hunt.
