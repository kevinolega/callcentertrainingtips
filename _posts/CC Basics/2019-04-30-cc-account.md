I often get asked, “What is a call center account?”
If you’re new to the call center or BPO industry, it is one of the first few call center words that you will learn about.

When you get hired in a call center, you will be doing work for your call center, but you will also work for your account.

The call center account is “the client” that your call center company is serving.

Several companies that offer call center-related work do not do outsourced work for their mother company.

Many companies serve other companies and offer business process outsourcing (i.e., call center-related) work for them.

An account is who the call center does business for or, in other words, the company you will be representing once you start to work there.

Here’s An Example:

Say you work as a customer service representative for a call center company called Sitel, and their account is Apple Computers, then when you answer your phone, you say “Thank you for calling Apple Computers!” instead of answering with “Thank you for calling Sitel.”

You are not employed by Apple Computer, but you represent Apple computer because they are your employer’s client.

When you work in a call center, the company you represent to the end consumer is not always the same as your employer.

## REMEMBER:

An account means your employer’s client in a call center.

You represent your employer’s client at work. 


Recently people don't use the term "call center account" as much but instead use LOB or line of business. insert definition and examples.

### Frequently Asked Questions about Call Center Accounts

---

**🟩 Is a call center account the same as a client?**  
Yes. In a BPO setup, your **call center account** is the **client company** your employer is working for. You’re hired by the call center, but you represent the account when you talk to customers.

> 💡 **Think of it like being a barista at a café inside a mall.**  
You’re hired by the mall (the BPO), but every time you wear your apron and serve coffee, you're representing Starbucks (the account). Customers don’t care about the mall—they see you as a Starbucks employee.

---

**🟩 Do I work for the account or the call center company?**  
You’re officially employed by the **call center company** (like Concentrix or Teleperformance). But the **account** is the brand you’re trained to represent (like Amazon, AT&T, or Apple). To the customer, **you are the face of the account**.

> 💬 When I worked under the Comcast account, I always answered the phone with,  
> “Thank you for calling Comcast,” — never “Thank you for calling [BPO name].”  
> Even though I never stepped foot in a Comcast office, I knew their products and customers better than some of their full-time staff.

---

**🟩 Can I be assigned to different accounts?**  
Yes. If your current account closes, you may be **retrained and reassigned** to a new account. That’s part of the flexibility of working in a call center. If you're a strong performer, you’ll likely be prioritized for reassignment.

> 📦 A trainee I worked with started in Telco customer service. The account shut down after a year. He stayed employed, got retrained in e-commerce chat support, and actually preferred the new setup. The skills transferred. The pay improved.

---

**🟩 What happens if I don’t like my account?**  
You can **request a transfer**, but it depends on company policy and account availability. Some agents start in one account and later shift to another with better hours, tools, or management.

> 🔄 One agent I coached moved from outbound sales to a retention LOB under the same account. Less pressure, same pay, better fit. It happens—but performance and attitude matter.

---

**🟩 What’s the difference between an account and an LOB (Line of Business)?**  
The **account** is the client company (like Amazon). The **LOB** is your department or function within that account.

For example:  
- You’re in the **Sales LOB** for the **Amazon account**  
- You’re in the **Tech Support LOB** under **Comcast**

> 🧭 Think of the account as the country, and the LOB as your specific job inside that country—like customs, immigration, or tourism. Everyone represents the same flag but handles a different task.
