One question I often get asked is: 

What is a BPO?

What is the relationship of BPO to call center work?

In this lesson, we will discuss what a BPO is.

We will also discuss how knowing the meaning of BPO can help increase your chances of getting hired in a call center.

Understanding BPO will enable you to understand what kind of job you are getting in to.

You can prepare better as a result.

BPO stands for business process outsourcing.

A business process is simply a series of steps necessary to the survival of the business.

## Examples Of Business Processes Include:

- Sales process
- Customer support or customer service process.
- Order taking process
- Collection process.
- Document processing.
- and so on.

## Outsourcing is asking someone else to do work for you and paying them for the work.

## You Outsource Work Because:

- the cost of completing the task is cheaper (cost-effective) compared to doing the task yourself.
- professionals can do the tasks better than you (quality),
- you don’t have the time to do the tasks yourself (convenience)

## We Outsource Tasks Regularly.

- we outsource laundry to laundry shops.
- we outsource meal preparation to fast foods and restaurants 
- we outsource our rides to public transportation and other providers.

Business process outsourcing is similar to outsourcing our personal tasks.

The only difference is the company is outsourcing business processes.

Almost any business process can be outsourced.

## Here Are Common Outsourced Business Processes In A Call Center.

- Customer Service
- Technical Support
- Sales

These are the top three outsourced jobs.

A lot of Call Center Jobs are in these three fields.

There are more, but you’ll find out about that later.

Was I able to explain this part clearly?

Here’s my personal definition.

Are you ready?

Here goes.

Business Process Outsourcing is an opportunity where Filipinos are able to take on jobs from Europeans, Australians, and Americans because of advantages in cost, quality, and skill.

We are taking American jobs because we can provide services at a lower cost and at comparable or better quality.
 
Filipinos grew up with strong American cultural influence and can often speak English well.

As a result, Filipinos closely resemble how Americans speak and easily understand American business processes.

That being said, if you want to get hired in a call center or a BPO, the ability to communicate well in English is a requirement.

That means you have to speak, read, write, listen and think in English proficiently.
