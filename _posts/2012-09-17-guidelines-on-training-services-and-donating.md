**Services** 

I opened a [services page](http://callcentertrainingtips.com/promos/) for people who would like to support the site. The price for each service is indicated there. I would need your help in keeping this site alive and in exchange I'll do my best to help you get hired in a call center. 

**Donations** 

If you found value in the site and would like to help me continue the work send me an email to donate and I'll send you my bank details. 

**Free Answers** 

If you're broke I won't mind helping you for free. It would be awesome if you could leave me a tip later on but you can come to me for help. If you have a few questions ask in the comments or on the Facebook page or send me an email. I'll do my best to answer them. 

**Talk to Kevin** 

If you would like to speak to me send a message and I'll leave you my phone number. I use a globe number. If you use a smart or sun number, I don't have one. You are welcome to buy me a sim and a disposable phone to use but if not you can add me on Google+ or on Skype which are both free. My user name is Kevin Olega. 

**Talk to Kevin in person** 

You can also treat me to Starbucks. Tall Hot brewed coffee black if we're meeting in the morning or hot chamomile tea if we're meeting after work. I live and stay mostly in Sucat Para√±aque in the weekdays and I'm in Ortigas on Saturdays and Robinson's pioneer during Sunday. 

**Different locations** 

If you would like to meet somewhere else then please see the charges at the services page. 

**For free sessions we can meet when I'm available.** 

**I'm open for your ideas** 

You're also free to propose alternatives to these guidelines. As long as it won't be inconvenient for me I'm good to go. 

I would also like to meet my readers. If you would like to organize a class for your friends let me know and we will work something out. I'll ask you to buy pizza though but I'll make sure it's all worth it :) 

**Before you contact me I'll ask you do [do some homework](http://callcentertrainingtips.com/call-center-job-interview-preparation-questions//).**

Do you want more of these kinds of posts? Please let me know by sending me a message. I'll do my best to answer when I'm online.
