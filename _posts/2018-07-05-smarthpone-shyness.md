I’m a really shy person. 

I do make my money in an industry that requires me to throw away my shyness.

I tried sales, customer service work, blogging, making videos, freelance work and getting business deals.

For the past several years people depend on me to help them upgrade their livelihood.

I recently [uploaded a video for the blog](http://callcentertrainingtips.com/basics/) and I noticed that my confidence improved a lot.

I'm thinking if you do the same, you can get the same benefit as well.

How do you work on your shyness?

Why are you shy in the first place?

Isn't it because you feel that there's something wrong with your performance?

Pull out your smartphone, or borrow one if you don't own one and take a video of yourself.

> My name is Kevin. I live in Parañaque. I'm the writer of call center training tips. I used to work in a call center but I'm still working in the BPO industry. I think the call center industry is a great starting point for people who have big dreams because it rewards people who do well.

Do the same thing for yourself. 

Write down these five sentences that has the following details:

1. What is your name?
2. Where do you live?
3. What are you doing with your life?
4. What is your past work?
5. Why do you want to work in a call center?

After writing down your answers, get a smartphone, pull out the camera app, switch it to video and record yourself answering the questions.

When done, watch the video and take some notes.

What's wrong with it?

Did you speak loud and clear?

Did you smile while talking?

Did you take a deep breath before you began?

Are you happy with it in general?

Do you think if you showed this video to an interviewer they would want to hire you for a call center job?

Why or why not?

How can you improve your delivery?

What can you do to improve your introduction?

This is a technique that you can do at home to work on your shyness.

You can also read a blog post from anywhere. This blog works too.

You can literally record yourself reading this and check how well you do.

Just listen to how you sound.

Now that I wrote this, I'm thinking I'm just going to use this to test the skill level of people who ask me for help.

If you watch your video you can see what to change, make the change and be better.

I've done this with cooking, weightlifting, writing and a lot of other activities. I believe you can do too.

Record your performance.

Have the courage to look at yourself and what you suck at so you can get better. 

Notice your facial expression. 

Notice your voice. 

Notice how you project your message. 

That’ll improve your delivery a bit.

Watch your show and learn to improve your performance. 

Great artists do this. 

In fact, great artists do this, painstakingly when training for a live event with a coach and other people. 

I’m sure you can benefit from this practice too.

Send me your video and it'll be easier for me to help you out.
