Are you winning or losing?

Most people stop asking questions after they lose.

I failed getting a job in a call center.

I'm not fit for a call center.

I'm not qualified for the job.

I'm not good in English.

I experience mental block and couldn't speak during interviews.

I ask my students lots of questions.

When people tell me they fail, we study the failure.

Here are some questions that I ask.

Where exactly are you losing?

What question do you fail to answer?

What was your answer?

What is a better answer?

What questions are you able to answer well?

What are your answers?

Is the grammar good when you answer interview questions?

How would you rate your confidence when you answer interview questions?

Have you demonstrated in your answers that you would make a good employee with your interview answers?

Did you get the opportunity to talk about how you converted a weakness into an advantage?

Did you get to ask questions about the job?

Did you get the opprtunity to share stories that convey your positive traits?

Did you get the opportunity to showcase your ability to give step by step instructions?

I use many of these questions as a basis when I build a strategy for my students.

If you watch my coaching videos, you'll notice that we cover the same lesson but discuss different topics.

Every person has a unique situation.

What works for someone may not work for someone else.

That's why I teach one on one.

If you need help, let me know.
