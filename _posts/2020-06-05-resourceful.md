The lessons we send out are designed for easy printing.

They come out as easy to read and answer when printed out.

But if you don't have access to a printer or even a computer.

There is no need to print it if you can't.

It's not the fancy tools that you have that will help you succeed.

Your determination and resourcefulness is more important.

Use the tools that you have so you can practice.Â 

You are writing to practice communicating.

Always remember our goal.

You will practice English so you can...

Introduce yourself well, express your ideas and talk about your thoughts.

Ask questions that will help you understand your thoughts, situations and solve problems.

Give clear, step by step instructions that will make life easier for you and others.

Tell stories that will help deliver your most important message.

These are the four tasks that we send all our students.

When we have the phone coaching and send email recommendations, we help fix your grammar and pronunciation.

If you don't have a computer or printer work with what you have.

Your notebook and your phone are enough.

If you don't have access to a normal keyboard, you can write down your lessons on your notebook, snap a photo using your smartphone and email the images to us.

Just sit down and spend time doing it.

Little by little you can make progress and we're here to help you.

Go back to writing.
