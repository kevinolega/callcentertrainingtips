When you get to the interview or training, ask the person in charge what the most important metrics are.

I talk about my experience, and you may find yourself in a different situation.

Learn to ask, so you know what to say.

Here goes.

The top metric is usually attendance.

The solution to attendance problems is to cancel all personal appointments and reject all invitations.

Guard your sleep and work schedule.

Do not change your sleeping pattern for any reason.

The second most important metric is CSAT.

Keep your customer happy.

Observe your conversations and take note of words and phrases that upset your customers.

Ask yourself how you can say the words and phrases better.

Write your script and ask yourself the above question for all the words and sentences in your script.

The third most crucial metric is sales.

It is effortless to sell if the customer is satisfied.

Inform the customer about the offer and ask them to buy.

Sales in customer service situations only involve asking customers to buy.

There’s not a lot of convincing or hard selling involved.

Your job is to ask and to get rejected 98% of the time.

If you need two sales, ask 100 people.

Ninety-eight will say no, and two will say yes all the time.

The fourth metric is Call Quality.

Ask for copies of your QA evaluation and listen to recordings of your call.

Make a list of your mistakes and correct your errors one by one.

Ask the QA or coach what your biggest mistakes are and work on your mistakes in order of the impact the mistakes have on your score.

The fifth metric is AHT.

Follow the scriptwriting activity that I outlined for CSAT.

Focus on looking for long words and explanations instead of making your spiel more diplomatic.

Cut out words that you can reasonably remove.

Write shorter versions of the same sentence.

The shorter sentences work well for situations that you have to repeat yourself.

Can you tell me more about the problem that you’re experiencing? LONGER

Please tell me what happened? SHORTER

Is there anything else that I can assist you with today? LONGER

Do you need additional help? SHORTER

Small changes like these can help cut down your AHT.

The situation changes from company to company.

Ask the person in charge what you need to prioritize and fix your strategy one by one.

Are you still afraid of the metrics?

Don’t worry.

You’ll receive a script to follow when you start work.

I also have hundreds of free lessons posted on my website. https://callcentertrainingtips.com 

You can also send me an email if you have questions.

Tell me that you’re asking for advice about the Call Center Metrics chapter in my lesson.
