Many applicants tell the interviewer...

I want to work in a call center because I want to enhance my English communication skills.

Not going to happen.

Because the interviewer won't endorse you to the next stage.

In other words, you won't get hired.

English communication skills is a basic requirement for call center work.

The objective of the company is to make money.

They want to hire you.

So you'll talk to American customers eight hours a day.

They'll make money.

And you'll earn some money.

But to qualify for the job, you need to have good English.

Not perfect.

But it has to be good.

If you're not confident with your skills, I put together lessons to help improve your English.

So stop telling your interviewer..

I want to get hired in a call center to enhance my communication skills.

Because that's the fastest way to end an interview.

Just in case it's not clear to you yet.

Whenever you tell the interviewer you want to work in a call center to enhance or improve your English communication skills...

1. You are not professional.
2. You are using their company as practice for English. 
3. You are not confident in your abilities.
4. You have zero knowledge in a job that you want to apply in.
5. You don't care enough to use the internet to research what kind of work opportunities that they're offering.
6. You are wasting their time.

So please stop giving that answer during interviews.

And as a result, they won't be comfortable in trusting you to handle their source of income.
