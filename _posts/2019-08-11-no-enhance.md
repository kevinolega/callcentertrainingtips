Why do you want to work in a call center?

Interviewers frequently ask about your motivation on why you want to work in a call center.

Many applicants tell the interviewer this exact answer:

I want to work in a call center because I want to enhance my English communication skills.

Your plan isn't going to happen.

You'll fail because the interviewer won't endorse you to the next stage.

In other words, you won't get hired.

English communication skills are an essential requirement for call center work.

The objective of the company is to make money.

The company wants to hire you.

The company is hiring you to speak to American customers eight hours a day.

The company will make money.

You'll earn some money for your effort.

You'll need good English to qualify for a call center job.

You don't need perfect English.

You'll need decent conversational English to get hired in a call center.

If you're not confident with your skills, I put together lessons to help improve your English.

Stop telling your interviewer that...

I want to get hired in a call center to enhance my English communication skills.

Telling the interviewer that you want to enhance your communication skills is the fastest way to end an interview.

Just in case it's not clear to you yet.

Whenever you tell the interviewer, you want to work in a call center to enhance or improve your English communication skills...

1. You are not professional.
2. You are using their company as practice for English. 
3. You are not confident in your abilities.
4. You have zero knowledge of a job that you want to apply in.
5. You don't care enough to use the internet to research what kind of work opportunities that they're offering.
6. You are wasting their time.

So please stop giving that answer during interviews.

And as a result, potential employers won't be comfortable trusting you to handle their source of income.
