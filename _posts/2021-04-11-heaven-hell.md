What is your current situation?

Where are you right now?

Where would you like to be?

What situation are you trying to avoid?


Describe your situation?

Who are your loved ones?

What is your family's financial situation?

Who provides the money?

What is the source of income?


Describe your goal?

What kind of person do you want to grow into?

What's your dream job, career, or business?

Why do you want that career path?

What financial gain are you aiming for?

What is the benefit for you if you succeed?

What is the benefit for your family if you succeed?


Describe failure?

What kind of hell will your family be in if you fail?

What kind of job will you hold if you fail to accomplish your goals?

How would you feel about explaining your failure to your friends, future family members, and kids of your friends?

What financial disasters are you most afraid of?

What kind of hell will your family be in if you encounter that financial disaster and you fail to overcome your weakness?

Describe the worst case scenario for each of your loved ones.

Describe a cause and effect of the worst case scenario and a continouous escalation of your problems.




Imagine yourself twenty years from now and you fail.

How old are you?

How old are your parents?

Are they in an age where people normally get sick?

What will your situation be if you need to pay for hospital bills?

Combine this scenario with the failure situation described above. 

Name all the loved ones in your life.

How will they respond to your failure once they're 100% sick of your failure.

Imagine twenty years of consistent failure and everyone in your friends and family that you were defeated by laziness.

How would your former friends and family describe you?


How would you feel if the failure became your inescapable destiny? 


Here's what we did.

We described the present. (EARTH)

We described the positive future potential outcome if you overcome your bad habits. (HEAVEN)

We described the potential future outcome where your bad habits won. (HELL)

You want to position your goal (HEAVEN) in front of you.

You want to position your fear (HELL) behind you.

You want to keep your focus on the present (EARTH.)

You will have a choice every day to make your life a little closer to Heaven or a little closer to Hell.

Everything you do is your choice.

Twenty years from now, you will find yourself in either Heaven or Hell by your own choosing.

You decide where you want to go in the end.

If given a choice, would you rather have a painful now or a painful forever?
