90% of motivational quotes don't work.

Just focus on building confidence.

Fake it till you make it.

Just think positive.

It's all about how you present yourself.

That's because the writer of these quotes are smart.

These people are around other smart people.

They wrote or said these quotes, under the presumption that they're speaking to an intelligent person.

Unfortunately, you are not very intelligent.

Maybe you're only realizing this now.

The quote gave you a temporary boost.

You're a little braver.

You're a little more positive.

You don't know what to do.

Don't look for motivation.

Look for building actual skills.

Practice what you learned even if you don't feel like it.

That's the only way.

If your goal is to speak English well, you need to be speaking and writing.

If your goal is to learn how to sell, you need to be selling and talking to people.

If your goal is to learn customer service, you need to get used to dealing with people.

There's no way around it.

Quotes won't help you.

Work always works.
