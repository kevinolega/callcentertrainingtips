Hi There,

If you've been coming back often you probably noticed a few changes in Call Center Training Tips.

The goal of <a href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com">Call Center Training Tips</a> is to provide assistance for people who want to work in a call center.

If you have friends who want to get hired in a call center but would need a little help with their confidence or English skills then this I prepared this for them.

I've been hard at work to accommodate a few requests to make it easy for you to share the lessons with your friends.

## Here are the changes I've done so far:

### First:

I created a [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Call-Center-Training-Tips/449507911746386). Updates on this site will show up on your facebook page if you like or subscribe to it. You can also share the posts there so your friends can see.

### Second

If you're also on twitter, I also opened [a twitter account](http://twitter.com/calltipsph) for you.

### Third

If you have friends who would like to have someone to personally help them in their job hunt, I put out a services page. I could help out with their resume or with their confidence or interview skills. [More details here](http://callcentertrainingtips.com/promos/ "Services").

### Fourth

I made it easier to reach me by adding contact forms on the [contact](http://callcentertrainingtips.com/contact/ "Contact") or [services](http://callcentertrainingtips.com/promos/ "Services") page.

If you benefited or enjoyed the lessons please feel free to share with your friends or send me a message or leave a comment.

Thank you very much,

Kevin Olega
webmaster of Call Center Training Tips
