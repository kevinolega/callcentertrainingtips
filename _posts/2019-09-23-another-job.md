Getting hired in a call center typically costs money.

You are going to spend money, going from company to company to attend interviews.

If you get hired, you need to provide the necessary clearances like NBI, Police, Barangay and Medical.

And you don't usually receive your paycheck until after about two to three weeks of going to work.

[I wrote a detailed computation here](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/cost/).

But roughly, expect to spend anywhere from 10-14k pesos.

If you don't have any budget to apply, and you don't have the necessary skills to get hired immediately... 

It might be better if you took another job.

Maybe you need money for the day to day costs for when you get hired.

Maybe you need money to pay for some good training and enhance your skills.

Any job that you can take that pays you a decent amount will do.

So you can learn some work skills and you can save some money.

Work in a fast food.

Work in a store.

Accept a sales job.

Be an assistant.

Whatever it is, any job will do.

Just make sure you're earning enough.

So you can save money for call center work.
