Here's a few small things that you can do to fix your grammar problems.

## 1. Keep your writing in a one-sentence paragraph format.

This is an example.

It is easy to read.

Having space above and below each sentence allows you to see the errors.

## 2. Shorten your sentences.

It's okay to write 100 sentences.

As long as the sentences are short, your writing will be easy to understand.

Don't write sentences that are longer than two lines.

Writing compound or complex sentences sound intelligent back in school.

Long sentences are painful to write and difficult to say.

It's also the cause of 90% of your grammar problems.

You're welcome.

## 3. Simplify your words.

Don't use advanced words to cover up your lack of education.

I did this, so I know.

Simplicity is proof of true intelligence.

In call center work and business, the size of your rewards match how well you are understood.

Keep your words simple.

## 4. Read your sentences aloud.

Read your sentences aloud.

Listen to how it sounds.

That ten years of English classes didn't go to waste.

Your ears know what's wrong with your English.

## 5. Get help from someone capable.

Get someone to teach you.

But don't waste their time.

Don't be a parasite.

The least you can do is buy your teacher coffee from Starbucks or the largest cheeseburger you can buy.

Don't be arrogant.

Don't try to hide your errors.

Face and fix your errors.

That's the only way to grow.

That's how you fix your grammar if you're an adult.
