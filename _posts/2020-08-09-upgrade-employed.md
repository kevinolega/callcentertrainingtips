It's a lot easier to find a job if you have a job.

If your goal is to get a high paying job, it's challenging to find one if you're unemployed.

I noticed that several recruiters could detect if you are in a difficult financial spot.

These recruiters use your situation as an opportunity to low ball you.

You're almost out of money, so take this "amazing" offer, and your life will be better, they say, as they try to encourage me to take the lowball job offer.

I've been in situations where I've taken low offers because I need the money.

Often, these situations don't work out.

The work conditions were terrible, or I didn't fit the culture.

Worse, you are sometimes in a job where the job doesn't give you enough time to work on your personal goals.

You are often overworked and underpaid.

These days, I think more long-term.

I look for work while I have work.

I do my best to become valuable to my employer and increase my value.

I also look for opportunities where I can sell my skills at a higher value.

If I'm employed, it's a lot easier to ask for higher pay.

If I'm unemployed, the highest pay I can get is usually the same as my current pay.

If you want to keep upgrading your pay, look for work while you are employed.

If you want to avoid lowball offers, minimize your time being unemployed.

An additional tip, manage your money well.

If you have a lot of money, you can avoid being trapped by recruiters who manipulate your emotions to take low offers.---
