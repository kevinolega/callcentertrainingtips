What we do is hard work.

It's not easy to get hired in a call center.

You didn't succeed because of me.

You succeeded with your efforts.

You have to remember that. 

You're the person who didn't quit.

You're the one who made the effort to learn.

You squeezed your brain to answer my challenging questions and activities.

You succeeded.

Congratulations.

I'm so proud of you Claire!

Those five notebooks got you a job.

You'll need to buy another ten notebooks for the next stage.

Please go to work on time.

Remember all your hard work.

Message us for questions.

We're here for you.
