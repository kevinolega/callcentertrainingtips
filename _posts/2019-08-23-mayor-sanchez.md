The story of Mayor Sanchez is a horrible story.

I grew up hearing this in the news.

A college student with her boyfriend was kidnapped, raped, tortured and killed by armed goons.

The news goes into detail.

The mayor went to trial and went to jail.

I thought that was the end of the story.

I Googled him every now and then and saw that he's still behind bars.

A few days ago there's news that he's probably going to be set free.

Mayor Sanchez is the reason why good people need to be armed like murder machines.

A year back Duterte won because he proposed he'd kill the criminals.

He killed a few criminals.

Some innocents are killed in the crossfire.

Drug lords are set free.

So we're back where we are.

## How to feel safe in today's political climate

Evil prevails when good people do nothing.

The weak hands over their power to a few people who are strong.

My suggestion is you develop your own power.

Learn Martial Arts.

Boxing and Jiujutsu are good starting points.

Learn how to fight with weapons.

Local Martial arts like Kali and Arnis as well as Yaw Yan offers weapons training.

Then learn how to use a gun and when the budget allows it, go buy a gun.

If you can already afford to buy a car, you'll want to set aside money to buy a gun and own one responsibly.

You need to be able to shoot under pressure.

This is another skill that you can develop.

Go to the gym and become physically intimidating.

Don't take shit from anybody.

If you're a good person, you need to be powerful.

Don't be a weak person.

A good person and a weak person are two different things.

A good person is a strong and powerful person who doesn't use his power to take advantage of the weak but is perfectly equipped to deal with powerful evil people.
