A call center agent or a recruitment company earns money from referring call center applicants.

Referral fees are usually around 4k when an applicant passes screening then 2k when the applicant passes training and up to 15k when the referred agent passes regularization.

Different companies have different offers.

Some are bigger, and some are smaller.

That's why many recruitment companies offer "Free Training" so they can find suitable applicants to refer to their call center recruitment partners.

When a training center refers, the intention is to recruit and not to train.

The referrer intends to find applicants and earn money from a referral fee.

Sometimes they give generic English and interview tips, but that's it.

Learning skills no longer becomes the focus at these "training centers."

We decided to reject offers of partnership because we don't want to give our students biased advice.

We want to give recommendations that are best for the student.

We want to focus on helping students get the best jobs that they can qualify for.

We don't want the referral incentive to poison our judgment.

**If we had a recruitment partner**...

If we have a recruitment partner in Quezon City and our student lives in Para√±aque, we want our student to work where the work location is convenient for them.

If we have a recruitment partner that offers 20k a month and our students already qualified for a 25k job, we would tell our students to get the higher paying offer.

If we had a recruitment partner, both advice in the two examples that I shared is UNFAIR for the recruitment partner.

But if we PUSHED our student to take offers that don't make sense, it would be UNFAIR for the student.

A company that earns a referral incentive has an OBLIGATION to serve their company.

**Our students are our priority**.

Early on, we had to decide who to serve.

We decided that we want to help our students.

During training, we make our students list 20 companies that they consider working for as an employer.

In the same activity, we helped them research the salary and advantages and disadvantages of working for each company.

We teach our students how to analyze job opportunities.

At the end of the activity, we guide the students in selecting the best company available.

If the student needs our help as a reference or they want a recommendation letter, we can provide that.

That's a thousand times better than having a call center recruitment partner.
