You already know why you're a disappointment to your parents.

You put too much value on pleasure and entertainment and very little value on education and hard work.

You are no longer in school, so nobody scolds you.

But you are now suffering the consequences of all that slacking off.

You probably have millions in whatever game you play, but your wallet is just a joke.

The people that you care about are on the verge of abandoning you because you won't grow up.

Do you want to stay the same, or do you want to grow up?
