Open your mouth wider.

Speak louder.

Take a deep breath and smile before you talk.

Fix your posture and be upright when speaking.

Look forward as you speak.

Watch out for:

B and V sounds.

P and F sounds.

Th and D sounds.

Sometimes your Th sounds like a T.

Usually, the problem is you have these sounds backward.

You can do a Google search on how to pronounce any word.

If you fix 200 words, you should be perfect for most high paying jobs that require fluent English.

Some people never bother because they're too busy with the games that they're playing on their phone.

What about you?
