Ninjas are historical Japanese operatives who use trickery to win.
People in power use Ninjas to get things done.
Ninjas are expendible.
People in power also sacrifice the lives of Ninjas for convenience.
Ninjas are ofen sent on suicide missions.
Eventually, ninjas get exterminated by their own employers whenever their services are no longer needed.
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a ninja.
I saw this movie called Hunted with Christopher Lambered who's fighting against Ninja clans.
I played Mortal Kombat and copied the moves and poses of Scorpion and Sub-Zero.
I played Ryu Hayabusa in the Ninja Gaiden games.
I eventually became a big Naruto fan.
I like ninjas in media.
I loved the movie Ninja Assassin.
I also learned martial arts probably because of my facination with ninja.

Ninja moves are moves that can get an agent fired.

An agent may try to break something in the computer or telephone system to:

1. Drop a call with the customer.
2. Illegally bypass normal procedure to shorten a call.
3. Set the system on active without receiving calls.
4. Sneak out of work.
5. Use loopholes in the system to do something wrong but avoid getting fired because of a technicality.

Most ninja moves feel good short term but have a consequence of getting you fired.

I asked a co-trainee with lots of call center experience what ninja moves were.

She told me: If you're dealing with an upset caller, just press this code into your phone. The call will get dropped and you will not receive a bad survey.

I had a bad day and dealt with a bad call.

I pressed the code because I couldn't take it anymore.

Shortly after a teamleader went to my station and asked what happened.

He was listening to my call and everything went silent.

I was on a new call and couldn't answer him.

He implied he's going to let it go because I'm new but he knows what I did.

Someone probably taught me the code.

I saw him during my lunch and warned me.

The reason why the people in my batch with years of call center experience was eliminated is because of they used the code.

A few years ago, that code was untraceable but they figured out how to track dropped calls resulting from how they used the code.

I never used the code again.

Instead, I did my best to figure out how to be the best at handling the most upset callers and the most difficult situations.

In 2016, I became a freelance agent.
I learned that if you use the word ninja on your application, it's shorthand for skillful and disposable.
Clients will ask you to do the impossible.
They will pay you low.
They will fire you when they no longer need your services.
Working for employers who hire ninja is a sign that you are working for employers that have ZERO loyalty to their employees
