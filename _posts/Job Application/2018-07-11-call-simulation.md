Call simulation is one of the most intimidating parts of the call center screening process.

If you haven't experienced call simulation, you'll be asked to go to a space like a desk, cubicle, or phone booth, put on the headset, and wait for the phone to ring.

In some situations, the phone is identical to the standard call center headset. In others, it's a regular phone.

Sometimes, you're just talking to the same interviewer, a recruitment manager, a production team leader, or even a foreign staff member. 

I’ve even had a call simulation with an American and an Indian manager or client.

The screening process is designed to simulate the actual call center work. The call simulation gives the recruiter a chance to evaluate how you handle calls. 

When hired in a call center, you’ll be taking calls for eight hours a day, five days a week. 

Many people fail during the call simulation process because they’re unprepared. 

To ensure you never panic, we’ll prepare you for what to expect and how to respond effectively. Knowing the elements in advance will help you stay calm and perform better.

## General Rules for Call Simulations

### Never Panic

You learn to avoid panic by becoming familiar with the situation. 

Familiarity comes through study and experience. 

I failed several times before I understood the common patterns in calls. 

Take deep breaths before answering. Smile to calm your nerves.

---

### Never Get Angry

Customers might love you, hate you, or remain neutral. 

Never get angry, no matter the situation.

The customer isn’t angry at you personally; they’re in pain or frustration. Your job is to fix the problem.

If the customer says something offensive, remember it’s unintentional—pain makes people lash out.

Also, if a customer loses control and says words that you find offensive, remind yourself that people unintentionally hurt others when they are in pain.

---

### Reframe the Situation

Instead of viewing a customer as "angry," think of them as "passionate."

- A passionate customer wants their service restored.
- A passionate customer wants the best deal.
- A passionate customer needs their request completed today.

This mental shift makes interactions less intimidating. I imagine Antonio Banderas, whose passionate tone often sounds angry but isn’t. 

Whenever I use the word passionate, it puts a smile on my face and makes me less likely to take things personally. 

This approach helped me see irate customers as passionate problem solvers. It also earned me recognition as a "super-agent" due to my top feedback scores and sales.

---

### Use Positive Phrasing

How you phrase information matters.

Instead of: "Your package will be delayed by four days."
Say: "In four days, you’ll enjoy your package."

Always phrase things positively to avoid triggering negative emotions.

I make it a habit to reflect on situations where customers became angry. During my commute home, I think about how I could have phrased bad news better or avoided offensive statements. 

Constantly ask yourself: **"How can I say this better?"**

---

### Use Simple Words

Avoid overcomplicated language. Speak plainly and clearly. Grade two English is better than intellectual snobbery.

Keep your language appropriate and accessible. Five-syllable words may confuse customers, so focus on simplicity.

---

### Say it with a Smile

Smiling while you speak makes your tone more positive, which customers can perceive even over the phone. 

Try it consistently and notice the difference.

---

### Speak Loud and Clear

Project your voice confidently, especially if you’re shy. 

Practice increasing your volume and clarity.

You're projecting your voice to be heard in another country. This isn't the time for whispering or muttering. Speak with confidence and clarity.

---

### Avoid Dead Air

While waiting for systems to load, engage the customer by sharing process details or building rapport.

Ask simple questions like: 
- "How’s your day going so far?" 
- "How do you use this product/service?"

This ensures the call remains active and professional.

---

### Build Rapport

Talk to the customer about their needs and preferences. Building rapport creates a smoother interaction.

Find opportunities to connect on a human level. For example, ask the customer about their experience with the product or service.

---

### Use Common Sense

Stick to what’s necessary. Focus on resolving the issue quickly and moving on to the next step.

Avoid unnecessary comments or oversharing. The goal is resolution, not endless conversation.

## Elements of an Inbound Customer Service Call

### Introduction

Thank the customer for calling. Introduce yourself clearly:

> "Thank you for calling [company name]. My name is Kevin. How can I help you?"

---

### Acknowledge

Let the customer know you hear them. Simple phrases like:
> "Okay, I see."

---

### Clarify

Rephrase the customer’s issue to ensure understanding:
> "Just to make sure I understand, you’re saying [restate the issue]. Did I get that right?"

---

### Probe

Ask questions to gather more information:
> "Can you tell me more about what happened?"

Probe deeply and efficiently. Use open-ended questions to uncover details and fully understand the customer’s situation.

---

### Apologize

Express a specific apology:
> "I’m sorry you’re experiencing [specific issue]. I’ll work on getting this resolved."

Specific apologies demonstrate sincerity and build trust.

---

### Empathize

Show understanding of their frustration:
> "I know how upsetting this must be. If I were in your shoes, I’d feel the same way."

Empathy makes customers feel heard and valued.

---

### Assure

Reassure the customer:
> "You’ve reached the right person. I’ll make sure your issue is addressed."

---

### Verify the Customer

Confirm account details:
> "May I have your [specific information] to ensure I’m accessing the correct account?"

Verification prevents errors and ensures accuracy.

---

### Hold Procedure

Request permission to place the customer on hold:
> "May I place you on hold for two minutes while I check some information?"

Always thank them for waiting and set clear expectations.

---

### Solve the Issue

Provide clear instructions or transfer them to the correct department.

---

### Transfer Procedure

When transferring, explain the next step:
> "To best assist you, I’ll connect you with [specific department]. Please stay on the line."

Alternative phrasing: "I’ll get you some help by transferring your call."

---

### Summarize

Recap what was discussed:
> "You called about [specific issue]. We [specific action], and your concern is resolved."

Summarizing ensures clarity and reinforces resolution.

---

### Provide Additional Assistance

End with:
> "Is there anything else I can help you with?"

---

### Personalize

Use the customer’s name. Avoid "sir" or "ma’am" unless necessary.

This makes the interaction feel genuine and professional.

Don't use ma'am or sir.  

It's a Filipino thing. 

Americans go by names. 

It affects your confidence negatively. 

It puts you in an interior position. 

Your job is to assist them as an equal and not pretend to be lower than them. 

Using sir and ma'am tells them that you didn't bother to remember their name when they told you the first time. 

Using sir and ma'am is only allowed if the customer has a name that sounds like a curse word. 


---

### Closing Spiel

> "Thank you for calling [company name]."

Include branding as needed, ensuring consistency with the company’s style.

---

## Practice Makes Perfect

These steps are common in customer service calls. Practice them with a friend or mentor familiar with call center procedures.

Ask yourself after each call:
- "How can I phrase this better?"
- "Did I fully address the customer’s concerns?"

By consistently refining your skills, you’ll excel in call simulations and customer interactions.

Call handling procedure is different from company to company. 

However, these are the common steps in a customer service call. 

Knowing this will help you pass call simulation screening.

Always use your common sense. 

Listen attentively to the questions or what the customer is saying.

Ask questions if you don't understand. 

Always practice the clarify step.

Don't say, "come again?" Instead, use proper English.

I'm sorry you're cutting off. 

There must be a problem with the line on my end, can you say that again , please.

You can customize the spiel by always asking yourself "How can I say it better?"

Understand each element and practice using them. 

Practice with a friend with good English or someone who knows customer service procedure.
