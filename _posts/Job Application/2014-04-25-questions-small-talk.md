Interviewers ask a lot of the same questions every day on the job.

Here's an opportunity to consider.

The interviewer is likely bored.

The interviewer expects many applicants to be insincere with their answers.

83% of people just copy interview answers on the internet.

As a consequence, the interviewer will eventually stop seeing the applicants as a real person.

The applicant is not sharing their story.

The applicant is not communicating why the company should hire them.

A great majority of the applicants don't give real answers anyway.

You fail to communicate when you resort to memorized answers.

Do you know people who communicate using business quotes, wise sayings, and Bible verses?

These quotes are nice to read or hear once in a while.

However, people who only speak in quotes are difficult to talk to.

It feels like the person is trying to "lawyer" you using the quotes.

Interviewers expect to reject 95% of the applicants that they meet.

Interviewers are just skimming through the applicants that are not good.

Interviwers pay attention only to the good job applicants that qualifies for the job.

95% means that only one out of twenty applicants get hired.

If you don't get the interviewer's attention and give a good impression by keeping them engaged, then nothing will happen to your call center job application. 

Your resume, effort, time and money will go to the trash can.

## IMPORTANT SMALL TALK DURING INTERVIEWS

In the past ten years I follow this guideline that I used since I started looking for work.

I use the following questions to evaluate my performance during the interview:

- Is the interviewer smiling during the conversation?
- Did I get to make the interviewer to laugh once?
- Did I get the interviewer to talk about himself or herself?
- Did the interviewer give me advice on how to get hired?

If I answered yes to all four questions, then I'm sure to get a job offer. 

I have been self evaluating my job applications for the past ten years.

I often got a job offer whenever I get a the interviewer to smile, laugh, tell a story, and give me advice.

## How to Genuinely Connect with Interviewers

Here's how I get the interviewer to genuinely connect with me.

I begin the converstation with some small talk.

I ask questions.

Building rapport involves finding common ground.

I have an activity about writing everything that you know on a large sheet of paper or two pages, spread on a notebook.

I look for something that I like when I'm inside the interview room or the recruiter's office.

I ask about objects that caught my attention.

I also compliment whatever I find interesting.

If the interviewer has a beautiful smartphone, I tell them that they have a beautiful smartphone.

If the interviewer has a beautiful bag, I say that they have a beautiful bag.

Filipinos are often proud of their phones.

Girls are often proud of their bags.

I ask for some stories about the features of these items.

I eye an interesting object to in the interviewer's office.

I sometimes enter interview rooms that has a toy collection in the background.

I sometimes see an interesting desktop or phone wallpaper.

I also pay attention to books in the interviewer's office or random items like photos and decorations.

We talk about the object that I selected.

I'd like to get to know my interviewer too. 

I ask my interviewer about where they're from. 

I ask my interviewer about what school they studied in.

I didn't finish college.

A common conversation I have with people is did they get to work in a field that matched their college course.

I asked the interviewer if this was their dream job growing up.

I often ask questions like these...

I'm just curious. 

How did you become a call center interviewer? 

Did you initially work as an agent then transfered departments, or did you get hired directly into the HR or Recruitment department?

After listening to their answer, I sometimes ask...

What kind of course did someone need to study in order to become part of HR?

If the interviewer asks me why I'm curious I talk about conversations that I've had with other people.

Many people have told me that they wanted a job in their field of study. 

One of the things that happens often in this conversation is that, the recruiter will eventually ask me the same question. 

Why did I want to work in a call center? 

How do I feel about working in an industry that doesn't match my field of study?

I often have my answers ready for this question.

You should have that answer ready as well.

How long has the interviewer been working at that call center company?

Here's how I ask the question:

I'm just curious. How long have you been with the company?

What do you enjoy the most about working for this company?

If I'm confident with my previous answers and I feel that I'm going to make it to the next stage, I ask this question...

Do you have any tips for me? 

What rewards that I should look forward to when I get hired?

What warnings that I should pay extra attention to so I can perform well and pass training and regularization?

What are the biggest reason why trainees get fired early?

What are the biggest reasons why an aplicant does well at this job?

If I'm not confident that I passed, I ask this question instead.

I feel that my nervousness got the better of me today and perhaps I didn't present myself to you as well as I intended. 

I noticed a few errors in my pronunciation that I wasn't able to correct during the conversation. 

Can you tell me about the mistakes that stood out to you so I'll be able to make corrections for the next stage of my application process? 

I usually pull out a notebook and gesture that I'm going to write what they'll tell me.

Then I ask, do you have any additional tips for me?

Then I tell them how excited I am and sometimes throw in a few more questions.

I need to know about the job and the people who are hiring me. 

That's just how I believe things should go.

I see the interviewer as a potential ally who will help me get hired in a call center. 

If I don't win their heart then I can't expect their vote or support.

Asking questions and small talk give me a higher chance of getting hired in a call center. 

What's your experience?
