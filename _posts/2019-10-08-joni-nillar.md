We recently discovered that 
Joni Nillar a recruiter from Sutherland Global Services Philippines has been lifting articles from our website, [Call Center Training Tips](https://callcentertrainingtips.com).

## Joni Nillar was reported by our reader posting our lessons without any mention of who wrote the lessons.

According to a report from one of our readers, [Joni Nillar](https://www.facebook.com/jnillar) has been posting our articles and lessons on his personal Facebook page and possibly other Facebook Call Center Groups that he has copy pasted from our page.

## Why are we publishing our complaint about Joni Nillar?

We reported this issue last Saturday and did not get a satisfactory reply.

Our team had spend a significant amount of resources putting together the articles on the Call Center Training Tips website and Facebook Page.

We spent thousands of hours and personal funds to write and publish the lessons.

We appreciate that the Sutherland Recruitment staff found our content useful but the normal way to share is to click the "share button" on our Facebook post or post a link of our post/article or lesson on Facebook.

## What did Joni Nillar do instead?

Joni Nillar removed our names, contact information, links and anything that identifies that we wrote the article and he inserted his name instead.

He ends the posts with this statement as a signature:

>Your Recruiter, Sourcing Partner with a Heart ❤️
>
>-Joni Nillar

Our team went over his profile from October to August 2019 but couldn't see further because of his other content.

But we discovered several lessons directly [plagiarized](https://www.plagiarism.org/article/what-is-plagiarism) from our site and was posted on his Facebook profile.

Upon further investigation, we discovered that the plagiarized posts were also posted on the Sutherland Tarlac Recruitment Hub.

What's incredibly distubing and upsetting is Joni Nillar reused a photo from Kevin's personal Instagram Account and reused it, claiming that the books are from his "mentor". 

If you look closely, the name "Kevin" is written on the Fully Booked Paper bag.

Kevin and Joni does not have a personal or "metor" relationship.

Kevin only discovered who Joni is when the plagiarism was reported last Saturday.

## UPDATE

We are hoping for a peaceful compliance from Joni and Sutherland Tarlac Recruitment.

Joni initially said he will add the necessary links and attribution but upon further inspection, no action was taken on both the Facebook page and the Sutherland Tarlac Recruitment page.
