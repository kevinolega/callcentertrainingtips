DISCLAIMER: 

I am not a doctor. 

I'm not trying to become a doctor on the internet.

I am only sharing the supplements that I used to cope with my night-shift headaches.

One problem with working nights is maintaining a consistent sleep schedule.

My main advice is to make an effort to follow a consistent sleep schedule.

Follow the same sleep schedule for both workdays and rest days.

It's extremely difficult to go back when your sleep schedule shifts to a different time.

Accept that you have a different sleep schedule compared to people who have a day shift schedule.

If you're a smoker, do your best to cut down or quit because smokers have a higher sleep requirement because the body repairs damage during sleep.

Here are the supplement that I've taken too improve my sleep.

If you'd like more details, just google the name of the supplement and it's effects on sleep.

Budget: B-Complex

Value: L-Theanine

Premium: Phosphatidylserine - I buy the Jarrow brand (not affiliated).

Sleep cycle reset: Melatonin.

All these supplements are available on Shoppee.
