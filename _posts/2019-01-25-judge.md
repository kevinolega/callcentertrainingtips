People judge you even before they talk to you. 

Business owners do it.

Recruitment staff do it.

Hiring managers do it.

I do it.

Sometimes I don't respond to messages from people because they are rude or their account looks like a fake account.

You have to deal with it because it's the truth.

Is your Facebook account's name a proper name?

Is your profile photo a real photo?

What kind of photos or posts do you have on your account?

Do you use complete sentences that start with a capital letter and end with a period?

Is your email address based on your name?

Is your hair presentable?

Are you dressed well?

Do you smell good?

Does your breath smell fresh?

Are your teeth clean?

Does your English sound good?

Do you sound professional?

Are you asking intelligent questions?

Did you do research before going to the interview?

You don't get hired when you don't pass the test.

You don't get help if you don't pass the test.

Somebody else will be getting the assistance you are asking for.

Now at the end of this, you can choose for yourself what to do with the information.

You can become bitter.

Alternatively, you can work on becoming better.

The rest is up to you.

Go back to the questions I added to the post and answer them honestly.

If something needs to be fixed, go fix it.
