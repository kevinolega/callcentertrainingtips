I was recently asked what makes me different from other training providers.

Short answer: I have a how I did it training format instead of a here's what I think you should do format.

I don't know the current trend in call center training schools right now but in the past the business plan of a lot of call center training schools is to teach some English skills, copied from an English text book, give a few interview tips and refer the qualified students to their partner call center companies so they can make money in their referral program. The goal was not to teach you to qualify but to screen who are qualified.

I don't personally know a lot of people who have started from scratch and have bad English to start with and have improved to get hired in a call center and are teaching others to do it. As far as I know I'm the only one. Most people don't have the patience to do this.

My goal is to screen the willing and not the qualified. If you are willing to learn, I can pass you the skills. The first thing I learned when I started my working career is that any skill can be learned.

I look for the few things you are bad at that prevent you from getting hired and teach you how to overcome that.

I charge higher than most training providers because my time is valuable and I won't feed you bullshit. If you're not willing to pay, I give out my training materials on http://callcentertrainingtips.com/ for free anyway and all you have to do is to read it and practice the lessons and you should be fine.
