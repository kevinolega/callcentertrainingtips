Every year that you spend unemployed.

Every year that you delay.

You are LOSING MONEY.

Most people have no idea.

I'll teach you some basic math.

If you're earning a minimum wage of Php 455.47 a day.

That's Php 9,111 a month.

If you work for one year and get paid thriteen months, you make a grand total of...

# Php 118,450 a year with minimum wage

Here's a common starting pay in a call center.

If you earn Php 20,000 a month working in a call center.

And you earn thirteen months a year.

That's a grand total of...

# Php 260,000 A YEAR WITH A REGULAR CALL CENTER INCOME

Here's the common pay for people with two to three years of call center experience.

If you earn Php 30,000 a month working in a call center.

And you earn thirteen months a year.

That's a grand total of...

# PHP 390,000 A YEAR WITH TENURED CALL CENTER INCOME

How long have you been unemployed?

How much different will your life be if you had access to an extra Php 390,000/year?

If you took care of yourself well and committed yourself to doing a good job and was able to manage five years in a call center that's a grand total of....

# Php 1,690,000 after five years.

How much will your life change?

How much will your family change?
