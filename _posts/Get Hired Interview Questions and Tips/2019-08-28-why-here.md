This is a reader submitted question.

Why did you choose (name of company)? 

Why not (other company)?

When you answer, they still look for other anwers.

## My answer:

It actually doesn't matter what your answer is here. 

As long as your English is good and you sound confident, you'll be fine. 

I've given stupid answers to this question and still got hired. 

## Here's my favorite answer.

I see your billboard/poster/advertisement all the time and I got curious. 

I started asking around and checking the internet for feedback about your company. 

I found out that you pay 28k/month. 

So I became more interested and decided to try out.

After I walked in, the place looks like a good environment to work in and the people I've seen seem happy here. 

So I imagine I'd be happy working here too. 

Is it true you guys pay 28k/month?

Is that the limit?

Or does it go higher?

Are there other interesting benefits to working here?
