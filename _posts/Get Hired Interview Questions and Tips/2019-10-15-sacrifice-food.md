If you’re going to an interview or you’re going to work in a call center, or any difficult job, you shouldn’t sacrifice food.

If you sacrifice food, your brain won’t function properly.

And you need to pay attention and stay awake during training. 

When the interviewer says something, you need to stay focused and think quickly.

You may not know this, but thinking uses a lot of energy.

The brain uses about as much energy as doing physical activities.

If you run out of fuel, you might lose your opportunity.

Based on experience, most negative and depressing thoughts are a result of eating junk food or surviving on empty calories (pang tawid-gutom food) like rice and vegetables for too long.

If your problem is confidence, competence and courage, the quality of your food is worth looking into.

Please eat healthy.

You are worth it.
