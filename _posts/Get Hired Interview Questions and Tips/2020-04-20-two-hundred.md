Whenever I look for work, I call this activity Project 2.

Send out 200 online applications to jobsearch websites.

In the past, I used Jobstreet and JobsDB.

For work from home opportunities, I use Upwork and Fiverr.

If you're good at using computers, it may take you fifteen minutes to send one job application.

If you spend eight hours a day looking for work, you'll send 30 applications a day.

In seven days you've sent two hundred job applications.

If you're not good at using computers, it may take you thirty minutes to send one job application.

If you spend eight hours a day looking for work, you'll send 16 job applications.

It may take you ten days to finish sending 200 job applications.

The good news is, you'll improve your typing and computer navigation skills doing this.

Whenever you look for work, expect to get rejected a lot.

Not all opportunities are for you.

You may get rejected by 100 companies and that's okay.

If you get rejected by all 200 compaines then you need to upgrade your skills.

If you don't get rejected by 200 companies, you're probably not sincerely looking for work.

In the end, feeling bad and worrying about getting hired does not count.

Rejection is the true proof of your effort.

If you're not getting rejected, you're not trying.

Step By Step

1. Go to jobstreet.com and other jobsites.
2. Create an account (or login to your user account)
3. Upload your resume.
4. Fill out missing details of your resume.
5. Search for call center jobs (customer service jobs, technical support jobs, telemarketing
jobs, telesales jobs, billing jobs, collection jobs, etc.)
6. Send out about 200 applications
7. Repeat
You'll probably get serveral phone interviews by lunchtime if you start early.

Whenever I receive a call, I ask the interview if I can get a schedule later in the afternoon.

Getting a job is a numbers game.

The more resumes you send out, the better your chances are of getting an interview.
