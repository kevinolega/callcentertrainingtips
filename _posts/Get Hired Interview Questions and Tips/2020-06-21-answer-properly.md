Answer calls from unknown numbers properly.

If you're a professional or dream of becoming professional, you need to know basic phone etiquette.

When you answer your cellphone, please proceed to a quiet area with good reception.

It doesn't hurt to answer in English.

From personal experience, it always gives a professional impression.

This is my casual answer:

> Hello?

This is my answer in the morning:

> Hello! Good morning!

This is my answer in the afternoon.

> Hello! Good afternoon!

This is my answer in the evening.

> Hello! Good evening!

If I don't recognize both the number and the voice of the caller, I ask:

> May I know who's this?

If I can't stay on the phone and talk.

> I'm sorry. This is not a good time. May I call you back?

I always thank the callers.

> Thank you!

I hope you find this short lesson useful.
