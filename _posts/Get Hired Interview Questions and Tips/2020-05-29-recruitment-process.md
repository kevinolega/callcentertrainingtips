## Call Center Hiring Process
*May 29, 2020 · written by Kevin Olega*

Getting hired in a call center has multiple stages.  

American companies are hiring Filipinos to represent their company.

---

## Online Application

You typically send your resume to a recruiter and fill out an online form.  
**Requires:** Resume

---

## Walk-In Application

For walk-in applications, you go directly to the company to apply.

Many call center companies follow a one-day process and can complete the recruitment screening on the spot.  
**Requires:** Printed resume, ID, pen, and notebook

---

## Computer Exam

Some companies will ask you to input your information into their system instead of a paper form.

You may encounter:
- Basic English test
- Business English test
- Basic math test
- Typing test (25–35 WPM)
- Computer knowledge test
- Versant or Berlitz voice tests to check listening and pronunciation

**Requires:** Basic computer knowledge

---

## Initial Interview

You'll be asked to talk about:
- Yourself
- Work experience
- Career goals and plans

**Common questions:**
- Tell me about yourself.
- What are your strengths and weaknesses?
- Why do you want to work in a call center?
- Why should we hire you?

> 📝 Pro Tip: Practice telling real stories about your experience instead of memorizing generic answers.

---

## Group or Panel Interview

Group interviews may happen at the beginning or end of the process.

Formats include:
- One applicant, multiple interviewers
- One interviewer, multiple applicants
- Multiple interviewers and applicants

If you can handle one interviewer, you can manage multiple interviewers.

I like group interviews because the success and failure of all the other applicants give me an idea of what to say and what NOT to say during the interview.

I observe everybody’s answer, and I pay attention to who passes and fails.

This helps me avoid making big mistakes because I know more about precisely what NOT to do during the interview.

> Observe other applicants. Learn from their answers—what works, what doesn’t. It helps avoid common mistakes.

---

## Written Exam

You may be tested through:
- Multiple choice
- Fill-in-the-blank
- Short essays

Examples include writing step-by-step instructions for customer service, or telling a short story.

---

## Call Simulation

You’ll do a role-play:
- The interviewer acts as the customer.
- You play the customer service or sales representative.

Tasks include:
- Greeting customers
- Assisting with concerns
- Selling a product or service (for sales roles)

> ✅ Familiarize yourself with common call flows posted on this site.

---

## Final Interview

Handled by HR, the business owner, or hiring manager.

This stage checks:
- If you're a good fit
- Your consistency (they may repeat earlier questions)
- Your experience, education, and intent to stay

If successful, you’ll be scheduled for the job offer.

---

## Job Offer

You may receive this the same day or the next.

- You’ll review and sign your employment contract.

---

## Basic Training (Pre-Hire Training)

Some companies offer basic training before the job starts.  
You’ll learn:
- English communication
- American culture and geography
- Customer service basics and phone etiquette

> ⚠️ Don’t be late or absent. Some trainees are disqualified during this phase.  
> Don’t get too attached to fellow trainees—many won’t make it to the end.

---

## Product Training

Training focused on the account you’ll be assigned to.

You’ll learn:
- Account procedures
- Tools and systems used
- Service or sales process

> When you start taking calls, you don’t say:  
> “Thank you for calling Sitel/Teleperformance/Concentrix.”  
> You say: “Thank you for calling AT&T/Comcast/Verizon,” because you represent the **client**, not the BPO company.

**My experience:**  
At Comcast, training lasted one month. Then we moved to OJT.

> ⚠️ Be punctual. Out of 30 trainees, 6 were eliminated due to absences.  
> Don’t lend money to co-trainees.

---

## OJT (On-the-Job Training)

You’ll begin taking live calls, supervised by a trainer or team leader.

> ✅ Arrive early. Ask questions. Take notes. 
> Learn fast and focus on reducing your mistakes.

**Result from my batch:**  
Only 10 out of 30 trainees passed OJT.

## Pre-Regularization Evaluation

After six months, you may be eligible for regularization.

The company will assess:
- Your performance
- Attendance
- Plans to stay long-term

**Result from my batch:**  
Only 5 of us were regularized.
