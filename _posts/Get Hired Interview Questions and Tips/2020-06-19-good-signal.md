My best friend lives in the basement of his parent's home.

Whenever I call him, we couldn't hear each other.

He has to go outside so we can talk on the phone.

There are spots in your home with bad signal.

What's the situation in your home?

What rooms have bad signal?

What rooms have good signal?

When you receive a call move away from bad signal and go to spots with good signal.

This is important for interviews, sales call and it's basic phone etiquette since we're all using mobile phones now.
