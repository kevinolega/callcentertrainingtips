If you have a problem with over-thinking and worrying, you should practice writing down your problems and negative feelings. 

Write down all your complains. 

Then on your next writing session, put together your solution and write it down. 

On your next writing session, pick the best solution. 

This process may have a lot of steps but if you are committed to solving a problem, you will find a solution. 

People who succeed are masters of fixing all the small problems around them. 

If it's too overwhelming, put it on paper.

Then solve it like a fourth grade math problem.
