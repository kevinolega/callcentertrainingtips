Many call center companies follow a one day process when it comes to processing their applicants. 

This means you can already find out if you pass or fail within the same day. 

That"s a good thing because you would know when it"s time to move on to the next one.

If you fail the best thing to do is to move on to the next one. 

Don't forget to write down the lessons on your notebook though. 

That's what you need to to keep going.

Failure is part of the process. 

You want success you need to collect lessons from failure.

A one day process can mean anything. 

If you start in the morning the longest you can stay in the process is maybe in the evening already. 

Maybe if you start in the afternoon then you will end up in late at night or the next day already.

The longer they let you stay the better. 

That means you are moving forward with the process. 

Don't forget to ask your interviewer or proctor for tips for the next step.

I hope you do well.
