One question we often get asked is what is a BPO and how is it related to call center work.

In this lesson we will discuss what a BPO is and how knowing about it can help increase your chances of getting hired in a call center.

Understanding what a BPO is will enable you to understand what kind of job you are getting in to and as a result, you can prepare better. 

BPO stands for business process outsourcing. 

A business process is simply a series of steps necessary to the survival of the business. 

## Example of business processes include:

- Sales process
- Customer support or customer service process.
- Order taking process
- Collection process.
- Document processing.
- and so on.

## Outsourcing is asking someone to do something for you and paying them for it. You outsource something because:

- it’s cheaper (cost-effective)
- they can do better than you (quality)
- you don’t have the time to do it yourself (convenience)

## We outsource tasks regularly.

- laundry shops are places where we outsource our laundry
- fast foods and restaurants are where we outsource our food preparation
- public transportation is where we outsource our transportation needs.

Business process outsourcing is the same as outsourcing our tasks, except they’re outsourcing business processes. 

Almost any business process can be outsourced. 

## Here are common outsourced business processes in a call center.

- Customer Service
- Technical Support
- Sales

These are the top three. 

A lot of Call Center Jobs are in these three fields. 

There are more but you’ll find out about that later. 

Was I able to explain this part clearly?

Here's my personal definition.

Are you ready?

Here goes.

Business Process Outsourcing is an opportunity where Filipinos are able to jobs from Europeans, Australians , and Americans because of advantages in cost, quality and skill.

We are taking American jobs because we can provide it at a lower cost and at comparable or better quality.

Filipinos grew up with heavy American Cultural influence and can often speak in English very well and as a result, able to sound like an American and easily understand American business processes.

That being said, if you want to get hired in a call center or a BPO the ability to communicate well in English is a requirement.

That means you have to speak, read, write, listen and think in English proficiently.
