Call Center Love Life, a facebook page about call center and love life, posted a photo about how some people are very knowledgeable about their job and not very knowledgeable about how to find love.

I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

You don't need to know a lot.

Just as it takes me 16 interviews to find me a good job with good pay in a company that has a good culture that I'll be really happy to work for.

It usually takes me about that same number of applicants, I mean dates to find someone I want to go out with regularly.

You don't need to know a lot.

You just need to execute the little that you know.

Your knowledge will grow as you gain more experience.
