After, I've built my resume and after I sent out my resume online, I ask around for help.

I ask friends on Facebook.

I ask friends who worked in recruitment.

I ask my old clients.

I just let people know that I'm looking for work.

I just tell them that I am looking for work and to let me know if they have any job opportunities for me.

It's always a good idea to keep in touch with people who can potentially help you.

When the time comes, many of them can introduce you and get you interviews and appointments with other business owners.

Here's the thing.

I let my friends know I'm looking for work but I never depend on them.

I don't pressure people into thinking that I am depending on them to get a job.

The responsibility of finding a job is on me.

That's why I [send my resume to 200 companies online](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/200/) and [go out and try walk in applications](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/walkin/).

When it comes to getting a job from my friends, I don't get a good match all the time.

However, every time I do get a match, I get an awesome job offer.

So try and get referred by a friend and go out and apply on your own.

By the way, every time you do get referred, thank the person who helped you out and treat them to lunch.

Buy them a pizza or something.
