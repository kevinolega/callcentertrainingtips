Expect to receive calls from unknown numbers.

When you apply online or you post your resume online, expect to receive calls.

Even if you don't have an active job application it's always important that you answer calls professionally.

	Hello.

	May I know who's this?

	May I ask who's calling?

These words are not difficult to say.

When you answer calls in this manner, you always give a professional first impression.

It's not a disadvantage if you always give a professional first impression.

Here are some situations that I encountered.

## Situation One: Auto-Reject

I have a student who set her phone to block calls from unknown numbers.

We couldn't do phone coaching because my number always gets rejected whenever I call her.

I have to do the following steps:

	Step 1: Find her Facebook page
	Step 2: Send her a message 
	Step 3: Ask for her permission to talk.
	Step 4: She will call me

It takes forever to get to talk to her.

## Situation Two: Immature Answers

I have a playful friend who answers calls with profanity.

Instead of saying hello, he greets the caller with "tangina mo."

One time, his mom accidentally left her bag and he received a call from an unknown number.

He greeted the guy with "tangina mo."

We met up with the guy who returned the bag and they guy told him, he almost didn't feel like returning the bag because of how he answered.

"Make sure you answer the phone properly next time," the guy told him.

## Situation Three: Possessive Love Interests

When I did some recruitment taks, I have called some female job applicants whose cellphone numbers were answered by their jealous boyfriend.

The guy answered with "tanginamo sino ka? Bakit mo tinatawagan jowa ko?"

I gave my usual introduction.

This is Kevin I'm calling for "COMPANY NAME" and I'm looking for Jenny.

She applied for a job at our company.

We want to schedule her for an interview for a Customer Service Position.

"Ay! Sorry Sir! Akala ko kung sino! Sorry po!" the jealous boyfriend responded.

"Matagal na siyang naghahanap ng trabaho, salamat sa Diyos natangap na siya, teka lang, tawaging ko po, sorry po ulit!" the boyfriend continued.
