I'm shy and I avoid competition but sometimes I'm competitive too. 

When I compete, I look for every advantage I can get because I want to have an unfair advantage over who I'm competing with.

I learned early on that people forget about improving their mind after they graduate from college and it's the perfect opportunity to catch up.

Recall or research the story of the "tortoise and the hare."

### Here's how to catch up:

#### Step 1:

Buy a notebook and a nice pen.

#### Step 2:

Write down two to three lines of lessons a day, every day.

**Consider this.** If you write two or three lessons a day, in a month you have 60 to 90 lessons to consider. If you are consistent, in a year you have anywhere between 720 and 1,080 lessons to study.

If you do this everyday and do five instead of the minimum 2-3 you'll fill your notebook in six months.


#### Step 3: 

Review your notes. Writing things down helps you remember but reading enables you to continue learning.

### Can't think of what to write?

The lessons you have to write down doesn't need to be profound.

Think about simple changes and small improvements can make your life better over time.


### Here are examples of simple things I wrote down:

- Keeping your surroundings clean enable you to think clearly.
- Thinking on paper enables me to solve more complex problems.
- Avoid going out on a Friday and Saturday because traffic will take up your whole day.
- Adobo cut and pork belly are good sources of protein and fat while on a budget.
- Pay the extra ten pesos a kilo and get chicken thighs instead of whole chicken to have a happier eating experience.
- The cheapest cheese you can get is Emborg Mozzarella for Php 900 you get 2.3kg of cheese.
- Lettuce is cheap at Korean groceries.
- You can save time by buying meat scissors at the Korean store for Php 200-300.

### Here are examples of changes and lessons I wrote down:

- Buy the more expensive items. The cheap one will usually disappoint you. The couple of hundred or even thousand pesos saved isn't worth the heartbreak of said item breaking down at the worst possible moment.
- A book is an investment where you spend anywhere between Php 500 and Php 2,000 but gain direct or indirect passive income or savings of more than Php 2,000 a month. Online courses have similar returns.
- It's your job to educate yourself.
- You are 100% responsible for how much money you have in your wallet.
- Your results are caused by a combination of all your decisions in the past few years.




### Here are examples of crazy experiments I wrote down and tried out:

- If you keep your items below 150 things you will experience more freedom in your life.
- If you work on your skills and become genuinely skillful you can get more opportunities and make more money than a college grad at a nice school who doesn't know shit.
- If you practice eating once a day and remove rice, carbs and sugar from your diet you can get the body that you want.
- If you go to the gym you automatically have advantages in intelligence, focus and energy over people who don't go to the gym.
- I can go on and on.

### So here's a summary:

1. Buy a notebook and fill it with lessons.
2. Write what you discover yourself and write what you learn from others.
3. Instead of reading facebook, news and other bullshit, **study your notes**.

If you are mindful with your life you can be whatever you want to be and go where you want to go.

I already have the life I want to live because of a fucking notebook.

I'm teaching you how to do the same for free.

All you need to do is write two or three lines every day.

Do something smart and just apply this.

Remember that success is the result of what you do consistently and not what you do occasionally.
