This training is not for you if...

You are being forced by a family member to training.

You don't want to improve your communication skills.

You are perfectly content where you are.

You don't feel that you are worthy of a good life.

You feel that you will never succeed.

You are not willing to make an effort.

You do not need additional money.

You are born wealthy or married into a wealthy family.

You hate yourself and your family.

You are not willing to cooperate with the instructor.

You do not believe that life will get better.
