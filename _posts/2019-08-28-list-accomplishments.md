You have accomplishments.

Look at your life.

How old are you?

Write a countdown on your notebook.

I'm thirty four.

Write down thirty four (or your current age) at the top left corner your page and count down.

What did you accomplish at this year?

What blessings did you receive?

What skills did you learn?

Count your blessings.

Write that down.

Next. 

List down the different items in your employment and educational history.

Go through each of your life stages.

Here's an example from my list.

- Driving Training
- Video creation
- Project Management
- Work from home.
- Writing Jobs
- Online Training
- Cycling Training
- CrossFit Training
- Culinary Training
- Call Center Work
- Corporate Sales Work
- English Tutorial
- Business Development Training
- Office Work
- Website creation
- Sales Work
- Mall Clerk Work.
- College (1 Year)
- Martial Arts Training
- High School (Manila)
- High School (Parañaque)
- High School (Quezon City)
- Grade School (Quezon City)
- Grade School (Parañaque)

At the very least, if you passed a grade or got into a school that you're proud of, that can be an accomplishment.
