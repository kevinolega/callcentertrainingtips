What does articulating your thoughts mean?

I share free English lessons on my website.

What happens when you sign up?

I send you writing exercises.

I ask you to write their ideas on different topics.

I ask you to share some details about yourself.

I ask you to talk about their education and skills.

I ask you to talk about where they live or their hometown.

I ask you to talk about their work experience.

My goal is to help you prepare for interviews and other important conversations.

The interviewer is interested in knowing about you.

The primary interview questions are:

1. Tell me something about yourself.
2. What are your strengths?
3. What are your weakness?
4. Why should we hire you?
5. Talk about your past work and education?
6. Why do you want to work here?

These are questions that require you to talk about yourself.

Interviewers will ask you follow-up questions.

Interviewers usually ask six follow-up questions.

95% of people who apply at call centers get rejected for failing to answer basic questions about themselves.

What's the problem most of the time?

In my free lessons, I asked my student to send me a minimum of seven sentences.

83% of the time, the replies that I receive are one or two-sentence answers.

That's all I get.

You need to be able to articulate your thoughts and ideas.

You need to be able to express your answers in more than one or two sentences.

Here are some goals to aim for when trying to improve yourself.

Expound your answers.

Write more sentences.

Aim to write seven sentences.

Aim to write twenty sentences.

When you're comfortable writing, aim to write a fifty-sentence version of your answers.

You'll likely only use five sentences in the actual conversation.

However, most of your extra sentences make good answers to 90% of the follow-up questions based on experience.

I had poor communication skills growing up.

I got better are interviews, selling, getting clients, and negotiating because I practice writing about myself.

I also sell English lessons.

I can tutor you to become a better communicator.

I'll get you comfortable expressing yourself in the following conversations when you enroll in our English lessons.

1. Introducing yourself.
2. Asking and answering intelligent questions.
3. Giving detailed, step-by-step instructions.
4. Sharing stories that connect with your partner.

Send me a message if you'd like to participate in my training.
