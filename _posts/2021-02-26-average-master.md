I've been studying weightlifting and calisthenics for two years.

I know how to deadlift, squat, and press a barbell.

I know more complicated movements like snatch and clean and jerk.

I can do burpees, pull ups, and pullups.

I've competed a few times.

I've done the movements so much, I can teach the basics of these movements.

I'm a little bored by year three.

I've gone from obese to fit.

It's been six years since my journey.

My friends in this circle are still posting the same workouts.

I'm not exercising as much. 

Many of my friends now look like fitness models.

This is the difference between average and true masters.

Masters can do thes same tasks over and over again.

An average person just learns the basics and let go of the skill.

I've been writing every day for twelve years.

I can proudly say that I have a decent mastery of my writing skills.

In the same way, I'm embarrassed at how much I know about fitness, and how little discipline I have in this area.

A master does things that suck to ordinary people.

A master can do difficult tasks because a master has discipline.

Let's bring our conversation back to reality.

What is your weakness?

Where do you suck?

Where are you performing way below your potential?

Are you skipping your writing exercises because you are bored?

Do you want to be average or a master?

The answers to these questions are seen through the tasks that you do every day.
