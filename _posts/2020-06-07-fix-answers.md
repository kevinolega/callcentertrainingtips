I have a simple technique that helps me correct my wrong interview answers.

I interrupt myself in the middle of what I'm saying and use the words:

> "I mean..."

Use these words to correct yourself in the middle of the conversation.

So when you're speaking with an interviewer or anyone in English and you... 

- blurted our a Filipino word by mistake.
- mispronounced a word.
- said something with incorrect grammar.
- said something you didn't mean.
- realized there's a better way of saying what you're trying to say.

I interrupt myself by immediately saying I mean... then give my better answer.

It's important to do this immediately when you notice a grammar or pronunciation error.

If you're trying to get work in a call center, your interviewer is always looking for your mistakes and secretly counting those negative points for hiring you.

If you correct the mistake yourself, the interviewer will think that you already know how to speak the word, phrase, or sentence that you just misspoke.

And that's normal.

You can get tired and talk too fast that you stammer (bulol).

That happens.

And people think that's acceptable.

If you correct it, you actually display your ability to learn from your mistakes.

If you pretend that the mistake didn't happen and hope that the interviewer missed the mistake, guess what?

You are wrong.

Interviewers rarely miss mistakes like that.

You get a negative point.

That's also the wrong attitude with mistakes.

Mistakes should be fixed.

And if you realized that you made a mistake earlier like a few minutes into your conversation, you're allowed to say...

By the way, I realized that I made a mistake earlier.

Remember when I said, WHAT YOU SAID WRONG?

What I meant to say is...YOUR NEW ANSWER.

That's how you do it.

Try it out and see what happens.
