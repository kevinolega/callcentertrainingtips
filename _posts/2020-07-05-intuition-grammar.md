I know from experience that many Filipinos can score 70-90 points on most English tests.

Out of 100, Filipinos only make ten to a maximum of forty mistakes.

In the first week of lessons, I taught you three important lessons that can fix 99% of your grammar problems.

These are the:

1. One-sentence paragraph format
2. Break down long sentences into short sentences.
3. Read-test.

Here's a quick review.

## One Sentence Paragraph

A one-sentence paragraph means that instead of grouping multiple sentences together to form a long paragraph, you limit the size of the paragraph to a single sentence.

THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE USUAL MULTI-SENTENCE PARAGRAPH

I’m Kevin Olega, the guy behind call center training tips. I work as a project manager and virtual assistant to various foreign entrepreneurs. I enjoy writing, creating websites, learning new things, and meeting new people in my free time. I’m from Parañaque City, and I worked mostly in the Makati and Ortigas area.

THIS IS NOT A ONE SENTENCE PARAGRAPH.

This fixes 90% of your grammar errors.

When you break down your writing into the smallest parts, you can find what's wrong and easily fix your errors.

If you do this to all your writing, grammar errors are easy to spot and fix.

You can re-combine sentences later.

You can make your ideas complex later.

Your first version needs to have one sentence paragraphs, short sentences and gone through the read test.
