### WRITE EVERYDAY

- Write about yourself
- Keep expanding and continue writing about yourself
- The more you write, the more you can share with friends.
- Write stories. 
- Write a long version and short version of important stories.
- Aim to write more than 10k notes every year.
- You can't communicate if you don't have the words and sentences ready. 
- Writing is the best way to practice if you don't have fluent practice partners available to speak with.
- Talk to yourself using writing.

### USE TOOLS 

- Use short sentences and simple words.
- Use grammar check tools from Google Docs and Grammarly (free version)
- Google short sentences and check if other people use the same sentences.
- Record yourself speaking.
- Listen to your recordings and self-correct. 
- Watch out for long so's uhms, uhhs, etc..
- Smile and look at the camera.
- You can use a video or voice recorder depending on what you have.
- Continue working on your message until you're 100% happy with how you sound. 
- The more you get to tell the story the better you are at telling the story. 
- Practice sharing a story and listen to yourself.
- Fix your story on paper before you need to share the story in the interview.

### Write using a different format.

- Stories need to have a long version and a short version.
- People sometimes need additional details.
- People with the same training as you may want the short version. 
- Practice the short and long versions of your stories.
