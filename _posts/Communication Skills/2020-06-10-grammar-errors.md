I also have grammar errors.

I've posted close to a thousand articles since I started writing online.

Whenever someone tells me that I have a grammar error, I ask them where?

When I find a grammar error, I fix it.

When I someone tells me I have a grammar error, I smile and make the correction.

When I'm stuck with how to correct my grammar, I ask someone who can speak better for help.

I'm not perfect.

I just share my ideas online.

Sooner or later, you'll find my mistakes and that's okay.

That being said, being worried about other people finding your mistakes shouldn't stop you from doing something that you really enjoy.

For me, mistakes like these are no big deal.

I'll just fix the grammar as I find my errors.
