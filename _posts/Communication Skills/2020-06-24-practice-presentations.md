Whenever I'm nervous before a presentation or making a request, I write down a list of things that I want to say.

I also write down the different stories that I will be using.

I used to feel insincere for writing things before saying them.

I always thought that being sincere meant speaking from the heart.

A problem I had was I associated preparation with being a fake.

So I didn't do any preparation.

I went ahead and presented "from the heart."

If I'm inspired, the preparation went well.

If I'm distracted, the presentation was a disaster.

I've lost sales, interviews, gotten fired, and almost got sued, because of bad presentations.

When I worked in a call center, I discovered that my stories were too long.

Our calls had a time limit called AHT.

My boss warned me that I could get fired for staying on the phone for too long.

Out of necessity, I wrote down my script, and my stories then began cutting out everything I could.

I cut out the unimportant and uninteresting details.

I fixed the grammar errors.

I made the longer sentences shorter.

I simplified the words.

I applied positive phrasing to negative statements.

I arranged the sentences in the proper order.

I saw that my shortened story was the same.

I only upgraded my presentations.

I am still speaking the truth.

My presentation finally had no grammar errors, along with a proper beginning, middle, and end.

When I completed polishing my presentation, it is finally easy to remember and effortless to share.

As a result, my clients and employers all saw me as a reliable professional.

I became a consistent awardee of the sales and customer feedback incentive.
