Google Docs has a built in spelling and grammar check tool.

My favorite tool is Grammarly.

I have the paid version because I need it for my job.

You can make do with the free version of Grammarly.

I copy my writing onto the tool and I receive suggestions on how to improve my writing.

Grammar check tools can help you spot 90% of the typos and errors.

I still recommend using one sentence paragraphs.

I still recommend writing short sentences

Using tools to deliver better quality work is not cheating.

You need to work smart.
