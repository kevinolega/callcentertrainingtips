The smartest people in the world start with failures.

They are successful because of the failures and the lessons they have collected.

If you quit because of a few failures.

The problem is not that you are too stupid.

It is because you are so full of PRIDE!

And the pride is making you stupid.

You are not humble.

That's why you expect to win all the time.

You don't understand that everything valuable has a 99% failure rate.

And you get smarter, and you need to do 100 or 1,000 adjustments to get a decent success rate.

If you are a failure.

There's nothing wrong with going after success.

There's only pride, keeping you a failure.

Because if you are worried about the opinion of others.

Pride has taken over.

And as long as you allow pride to rule your life.

You will remain a loser.

And your biggest success will be a minimum wage job.

Pride makes failure permanent.

Give this lesson more thought.

Ask yourself this question...

Where is pride present in the biggest failures of my life?

Then write your answers in your journal.
