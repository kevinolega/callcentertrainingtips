### INCOMPLETE SENTENCES

Incomplete sentences are groups of words that do not express a complete thought.

One or more of the parts of the sentence is missing.

There is no subject.

There is no verb or action word.

There is no object or receiver of the action.

### COMPLETE YOUR SENTENCES

Please complete your sentences when you shorten your sentences.

Here's what happens when people shorten their sentences.

ORIGINAL SENTENCE:

I spend my free time writing, cooking, and going to the gym.

BAD ANSWER:

I spend. 

My free time.

Writing.

Cooking.

Going to the gym.

THIS IS WRONG!!!

These are not complete sentences.

GOOD ANSWER:

I spend my free time writing.

I spend my free time cooking.

I spend my free time going to the gym.

This answer is okay.

You separated the ideas into a complete sentence. 

GREAT ANSWER:

I spend my free time writing.

I love cooking.

I enjoy going to the gym.

EXPLANATION:

You're allowed to make variations to the words.

You can make sentences less repetitive if you're creative.

You can search for synonyms of the words if you're not creative.

For **EXAMPLE:**

I did not repeat "spend my free time."

I used the words "love" and "enjoy."

Alternating the words makes the sentence sound less repetitive.
