Here's a short practice activity to make a good impression on your Call Center Interviews.

Describe your favorite TV Show.

Describe a show you saw on TV while you were growing up.

Tell me about your favorite movie.

Tell me about the last movie that you saw.

Do these sound like interview questions?

This video is the most detailed description that I saw.

And it's fun to watch.

Are you able to describe a TV show like the person telling the story on this video?

If not, learn how to be.

Use this video as reference.
