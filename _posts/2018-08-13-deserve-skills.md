In anything we do, there's always a chance of success and failure.

It's difficult to predict the future.

Despite that, being intentional on doing your best, keeping a positive attitude and learning from your mistakes whether you always helps.

There are a lot of small activities that contribute to success.

Sometimes we participate in these activities, sometimes we don't.

Sometimes we are consistent and sometimes we do things poorly.

Like any good recipe, it takes practice and experience to get things right.

Success is a lifelong study.

If your goal is to land your dream job, and you are coming from an experience of shitty jobs, the task feels impossible.

There are a lot of failures along the way, but I can tell you that it takes time and a lot of courage to succeed.

Life does not give you what you want. 

Life gives you what you deserve.

Take a minute to consider the last two sentences. 

Let me type that again.

Life does not give you what you want. 

Life gives you what you deserve.

Just pause and think about it.

What is your dream job?

Do you deserve it?

Really? 

Looking at all your activities in the past five years, can you say that all your efforts make you deserve a successful career with your dream job?

The answer can be yes, the answer can be no.

Here's the thing.

Dream jobs require a specific skill level.

If your skill level is high enough, the employer hires you with very little trouble.

If your skill level is not high enough, the employer gives you a difficult time and often takes a pass at you.

That's a nice way of saying the employer rejected you.

That's because in their mind, you don't deserve the job.

Here's the other thing.

Deserve is not a constant thing.

If you don't deserve something now.

It doesn't mean that you don't deserve that thing forever.

You can learn to deserve anything.

You can solve the problem by asking yourself a few simple questions.

What skills do I need to learn to deserve my dream job?

What actions can I do to learn those skills?

How long am I willing to work to learn the skills needed?

Skills and attitude are like ingredients that contribute to achieving your goals.

The good thing about ingredients is that ingredients can be acquired. 

You can copy, learn, practice and eventually master the use of the ingredients that you need to use.

On the outside, attitude and skills don’t look valuable and that’s the reason why for the longest time we stopped picking up new ones. 

Consider this.

I've met several wealthy families who enroll their children at expensive pre-schools.

On top of that, they also enroll their children into expensive, advance learning after school programs like Kumon Math and MSA Tutorial.

When the kid enters high school, they get conversations about career, college courses and the like.

 The kid is then offered incentives to qualify at the best schools.

After graduating from the best schools, the young adult works for the best companies and goes after promotions and at the same time enhancing their skills through additional classes and eventually MBA or Masters degree.

Now on the other end.

A lot of people I've met never picked up a book or taken another class after college.

For a lot of people, no further education after high school.

The people in this situation are stuck in minimum wage jobs or jobs that pay less.

A lot of these people start a family and repeat the process.

That's fucked up.

I'm not from the first example.

I had to study on my own by buying books, taking seminars and classes.

I also learned from mentors both in person and through the internet.

According to many of the people I learned from, skills are the name of the game.

When you learn new skills, you become more valuable.

Just as learning to properly clean your room and make your own meals, positive skills and attitudes unlock opportunities.

I landed several jobs because of skills and attitudes I picked up.

I got my first job because the hiring manager was interested in martial arts and I promised to teach him. 

I learned the basics of sales in that job and became good at my sales and people skills and eventually qualified for several jobs.

In fact, a few months after, I got hired by a sales manager and made a good income doing sales related work.

I improved my sales skills and practiced learning how to train in a part-time job and eventually got offered a job at a call center school.

While working there I volunteered to do a job and eventually I was offered an opportunity in a recruitment company. 

I learned about different opportunities I could explore and took action. 

I was able to increase my income.

If learning a few small things took an idiot like me to different places and opened up amazing opportunities. 

Many people still think I’m smart. 

I’m not. 

I just learned a positive attitude and a good set of skills.

Here's the thing.

I believe you can do better. 

With the right skills and a good mix of some ingredients, mostly what you already have we can take a step closer to landing your dream job.

Back in 2014, I spent a lot of time learning how to cook and ended up watching a lot of cooking shows. 

As a result, I got better at teaching others.

There's a lot more examples.

I look forward to sharing on the website.
