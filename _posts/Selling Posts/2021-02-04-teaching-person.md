The reason why we keep our training online and over the phone is because calls don't consume a lot of resources.

We need to account for:

- Transportation
- Time spent in commute.
- Salary of support staff.
- Venue.
- Equipment rental.

These are considerations when teaching a student in person.

You'll likely spend 1-2 hours commuting to visit a student if you're trying to earn your living teaching in Metro Manila. 

That will give you time to spend four hours per student and only bill two hours.

What does that mean?

Let's consider the following scenario.

You charge ₱300 per hour.

Most of your students get two hours per session for your services.

You get paid ₱600 per session for a two hour session.

You potentially lost ₱600 if you spent two hours commuting to and from the student's house.

Many teachers avoid doing tutorials because of the lost income.

In many cases, you can teach a maximum of two students a day.

That's it.

About 80% of your time is spent teaching in traffic.

If you're teaching over the phone, you can accommodate one student an hour.

You can accommodate a maximum of eight students during a full workday.

Koreans, Chinese and Japanese students and parents have figured this out.

That's the main reason why many of our Asian neighbors hire Filipino English teachers to teach English over the phone.

The funny thing is, many of the Filipinos that I've spoken to are apprehensive about learning over the phone.
