It's incredibly easy to advance in your career and life.

Eat right.

Sleep right.

Exercise right.

Hang out with the right people.

Keep collecting and enhancing your skills.

Look for better opportunities.

Only make intelligent investments in your time and effort.

But it is incredibly easy to get sucked in to a miserable life.

Because many distractions are attractive.

Junk food is addictive.

Netflix, FB scrolling and games are addictive.

Not going to the gym feels good.

The WRONG people are so fun to be with.

Entertainment feels rewarding compared to improvement.

And your current status is more comfortable than feeling rejected.

And inevitably, we invest our LIFE in the WRONG things.

And your life becomes EXACTLY what YOU have right NOW.

I ❤️ guys.
