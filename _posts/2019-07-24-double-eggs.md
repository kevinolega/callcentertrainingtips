Here's how to double your extra money while working in a call center.

## Step 1: Buy dozen eggs. 

Go to the grocery and buy a dozen eggs

## Step 2: Look for a recipe on how to boil the egg. 

My favorite chefs are Gordon Ramsay, Heston Blumenthal and Jamie Oliver.

## Step 3: Boil the egg. 

Follow the instructions from the website or the video on how to boil the egg.

## Step 4: Sell the egg for 12 pesos each.

That's it. At the time I did this supermarket eggs cost 6 pesos. 

I sold each egg for 12 pesos.

I imagine you can sell it for 15 pesos.

## Step 5: Add salt to your baon. 

Salt is cheap. I like Himalayan Pink Salt.

## Here are computations from the time I did this in a call center:

Initial investment: P72

Ending balance: P 144

Profit if you sell one dozen for 20 days: P 1,440

Profit if you sell two dozen for 20 days. P 2,880

Do this for two years you can buy an iPhone 7 plus, iPad Pro or Macbook.

## Downsides to selling eggs

I classify these as costs of doing this business.

15 minutes prep and cook time.

You can only sell 2 dozen eggs maximum sa call center kung magaling ka mag tago sa guard.

Pag nahuli ka sabihin mo nag-gym ka and kailangan mo ng protein every 2 hours kaya madami kang egg. 

Baon mo yan.
