If your home has a TV, playing kids, farm animals or anything noisy, look for a quiet place with good signal where you can take the call.

Let people at home know that you are expecting an interview or an important call.

Inform them in advance that you will ask them to keep quiet or turn the TV or music down when you receive the call.

Go to a quiet place and answer your calls from there.

This is useful for:

- Phone Interviews
- Work from home situations.
- Skype and Online meetings
- Online classes
- Sales calls
