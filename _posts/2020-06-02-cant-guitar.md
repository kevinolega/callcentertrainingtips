I never learned to play the guitar.

I downloaded all the free guides online.

I had the lyrics and chords of my favorite songs from my favorite bands.

I asked my friends to teach me the guitar.

We stop practicing after a couple of sessions.

I downloaded apps and software that can help me.

Despite all that effort...

I can't play a single song.

I tell everyone I meet who can play an instrument that I have zero talent or musical abilities.

I've said it so many times, I automatically say this when I meet someone who plays the guitar.

As I was writing this, I remember that I never took guitar lessons.

I never paid a teacher.

I'm the reason why I can't play the guitar.

I never enrolled in guitar lessons.
