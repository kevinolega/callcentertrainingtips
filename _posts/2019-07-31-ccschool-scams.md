When people ask me if they should go to Call Center Training Schools, I usually say yes.

If you have the opportunity to take training and someone else will pay for it, you should take it.

But as I grew older, I became more and more skeptical about free training.

I'm 34 at the time of this writing.

And I've attended dozens of training sessions from different providers.

Some were free.

Some were paid but not very expensive because a company sponsored it.

And some were very very expensive.

I also experienced buying books.

Ever since I was eighteen, I set aside Php 500 per payday as a budget to buy books.

In the first half of 2019, I spent 20k on books and 10k on online training programs.

I bought online courses.

And I subscribe to online services that helped me improve my life.

I also offer to treat potential mentors for lunch or coffee or to buy from them just so I get the chance to ask some questions.

My income has grown.

And I now have the ability to fully pay for my own training.

And I learned.

With my years of experience.

That the best return on investment is an investment in learning skills though books and learning programs.

And I now understand that...

YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.

If something is free...

It's either...

Not very good.

Or you pay, by some other means.

I'm not very enthusiastic about call center training schools.

Even if already I spent four years working for one.

The main difference is I worked for a call center school that charged money for lessons.

We get paid.

We give lessons.

And we have a reputation of helping people get hired.

That's why people pay us.

And if nobody got hired, we won't be getting new enrolees.

In my time there, we have helped over 2,000 students get hired in a call center.

Many people got hired immediately.

Some people required extra effort.

And I did my best to help everyone who struggled.

I gave them my personal phone number and my email address.

I gave them extra lessons with my personal strategies so they will get hired.

I made sure that everyone who put in the effort succeeded.

Because personally, I know what it's like to worry about getting a job.

And I know what it's like to easily get a job.

After gaining the experience that I have now.

## What's wrong with Free Call Center Training Schools?

Many recruitment companies offer "free call center training" as a recruitment event.

The intention is to find people they can recruit immediately.

They will conduct a "generic English class" to screen for people that they can already endorse to mass hiring call center companies.

In other words the teaching is just a show.

They are looking for people to endorse.

And they're not offering additional help.

But the other problem is...


What I believe is the true problem in these "free training for call center"..;

Is that it's just a "generic English class."

It's not intended to teach you how to get hired in a call center.

I mean, sure they "hope" you learn something and pass the screening.

Because more money for them.

But hope is not a strategy.

It's not a training program designed by someone who's actually trying to solve your problem.

It's a generic "English class".

You're probably going to learn a few English words.

But for the most part, many people do not get hired in these free training programs.

## Why am I better?

I charge money for help.

And I have true experience.

I struggled to find work in a call center when I was starting out.

When I figured out what's wrong with my approach...

And made the necerssary corrections.

I have passed dozens of call center interviews.

I worked in a Call Center Training School.

And I personally helped people get hire in a call center.

I worked in sales and made six figure income.

I got a high paying job in corporate sales.

I experienced failure and depression.

I wrote a boook that [helped hundreds of people get hired in a call center](http://callcentertrainingtips.com/testimonials).

I went to a call center while I was depressed and became Top Agent and consistent top performer for three years.

I used the call center money to build my new life.

I built my work from home freelance business.

And I help people as part of my community service.

So I don't help everyone.

And I only charge a small amount for my training sessions.
