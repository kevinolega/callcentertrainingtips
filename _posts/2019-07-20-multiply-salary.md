Call center money is big enough.

If your goal is to buy upgrades that will improve your life.

If your goal is to buy lessons that will improve your life.

If your goal is to get started on going after your dream job.

Call center money is not enough for luxury. (luho)

You can't buy beer for all your friends with call center money.

You can't buy an expensive wedding with call center money.

You can't buy a brand new car with call center money.

You can't rebuild a big house with call center money.

You can't buy an iPhone every year with call center money.

You can't travel every six months with call center money.

I think you can but you will probably have NOTHING SAVED FOR EMERGENCIES.

And when the emergency comes, you will be at the mercy of people who have money.

Use your money wisely.

Use the money to upgrade yourself.

Buy a notebook.

Start writing.

Buy books.

Start feeding your mind.

Get around the right people.

Stop hanging out with your loser friends and family members.
