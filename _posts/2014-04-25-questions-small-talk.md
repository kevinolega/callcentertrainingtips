Interviewers ask a lot of the same questions every day on the job.

The opportunity is that, the interviewer is that usually bored and  they expect people to be insincere with their answers. 

83% of people just copy interview answers on the internet.

As a result, the interviewer will eventually stop seeing the applicants as a real person sharing their story and why the company should hire them because a great majority of applicants don't give real answers anyway.

They expect to not hire 95 percent of the applicants that they meet so they are just skimming through the applicants that are not good and pay attention only to the good ones that they will be hiring. 

When you say 95%, that means only one out of twenty applicants.

If you don't get their attention and give a good impression by keeping them engaged, then nothing will happen to your call center job application. 

Your resume, effort, time and money will go to the trash can.

In the past ten years I have a guideline since I started looking for work.

- Did I get the interviewer to talk about himself or herself?
- Is the interviewer smiling during the conversation?
- Did I get to make the interviewer to laugh once?

This is my simple checklist that I use to evaluate my interview.

If I answered yes to all three questions, then I'm sure to get a job offer. 

I have been self evaluating my job applications for the past ten years and whenever I get a yes to all three, most of the time, I'm good with a job offer.

All I do is start some small talk with the interviewer by asking questions.

Building rapport involves finding common ground.

I have an activity about writing everything that you know on a large sheet of paper or two pages, spread on a notebook.

When I'm inside the interview room or the recruiter's office, I look for something that I like, ask about it and give a compliment. 

We talk about smart phones (people are always proud of their phones) bags for girls and so on. 

I pick something interesting in their office like a toy collection or a desktop or phone wallpaper that I noticed, a book or a random item.

I'd like to get to know my interviewer too. 

I ask about where they're from. 

I ask about what school they studied in.

I didn't finish college, and a common conversation I have with other people is that, they wanted to work in a field that matched their college course.

So I also ask about that.

I often ask like this...

I'm just curious. How did you become a call center interviewer? Did you initially work as an agent then transfered departments, or did you get apply straight to the HR or Recruitment department?

After listening to their answer, I sometimes ask...

What kind of course did someone need to study in order to become part of HR?

And if they ask me why I'm curious. I tell them about, the common conversation that I have with people who wanted to work in their field of study.

But one of the things that happen in this conversation is that, the recruiter will eventually ask me the same question. 

Why did I want to work in a call center? How do I feel about working in an industry that doesn't match my field of study.

And you should have that answer ready.

How long have they've been working there?

I ask...

I'm just curious. How long have you been with the company?

What do you enjoy the most about working for this company?

If I'm confident with my previous answers and I feel that I'm going to make it to the next stage, I ask this question...

Do you have any tips for me, like rewards that I should look forward to when I get hired and warnings that I should pay extra attention to so I can perform well and pass training and regularization?

If I'm not confident that I passed, I ask this question instead.

I feel that my nervousness got the better of me today and perhaps I didn't present myself to you as well as I intended. I noticed a few errors in my pronunciation that I wasn't able to correct during the conversation. Can you tell me about the mistakes that stood out to you so I'll be able to make corrections for the next stage of my application process? 

I usually pull out a notebook and gesture that I'm going to write what they'll tell me.

Then I ask, do you have any additional tips for me?

Then I tell them how excited I am and sometimes throw in a few more questions.

I need to know about the job and the people who are hiring me. 

That's just how I believe things should go.

I see the interviewer as a potential ally who will help me get hired in a call center. 

If I don't win their heart then I can't expect their vote or support.

Asking questions and small talk give me a higher chance of getting hired in a call center. 

What's your experience?
