The most common call center jobs are Customer Service, Sales, and Tech Support.

There are different business processes being outsourced to the Philippines.

Call center companies receive outsourcing requests and projects from multinational companies abroad and from small and medium enterprises.

Locally, call center companies are starting to accept call center projects from local companies, and some local companies are now putting up their own internal call centers.

Call Center Jobs are solutions to problems, so if you would like to accept a call center job, you must first understand that you are providing solutions to a problem.

At times the work will be uncomfortable (at first) or stressful (if you’re not doing the tasks correctly), but that’s why they pay you.

As professionals, we are paid to solve problems.

What we can do to improve the situation is to try to improve ourselves bit by bit.

Here’s a shortlist of the most common call center jobs in the Philippines:

## CUSTOMER SERVICE

Customer service agents often handle service requests, inquiries, follow-ups, complaints, etc.

You’ll know the rules of how big companies run.

You’ll have a bird’s-eye view of the customer acquisition and customer retention side of big businesses.

You’ll understand ordering, support, and refund procedures.

You’ll practice dealing with difficult people.

You’ll become more diplomatic and people-oriented.

You’ll learn how to deal with customer service and negotiate what you want in your personal life.

## TECHNICAL SUPPORT

Technical support agents (or representatives) often handle troubleshooting, help desk requests that are mostly technical in nature or specific to certain technologies.

You’ll know what goes behind the scenes after a product is purchased.

You’ll have a bird’s-eye view of several technologies and services.

You’ll understand repair, support, and technical procedures.

You’ll practice dealing with tech-savvy customers.

You’ll become more detail-oriented and conscientious.

You’ll learn how to deal with complicated problems and solve difficult obstacles in your personal life.


## SALES REPRESENTATIVE

Sales agents or (representatives)handle the money-making aspect of the business where they offer solutions to clients or prospects in the form of products and services.

You’ll know what to do to convert a contact into cash.

You’ll have a bird’s-eye view of how businesses make money.

You’ll understand psychology, motivation, and persuasion.

You’ll practice dealing with a diverse number of people.

You’ll become more results-oriented and extroverted.

You’ll learn how to convert problems and obstacles into opportunity and money.

### KEVIN’S NOTES:

I personally believe that it’s a good idea to learn a bit about the three roles because one skill would complement the other.

Customer service helps improve your patience and knowledge of different business processes.

Technical support helps you improve your product knowledge, analysis, and problem-solving skills.

Sales teach you how to be persistent and become more convincing.

Remember that all these jobs can be both inbound or outbound.

### WHAT SHOULD I CHOOSE?

You’ll guide the customer to how they can get what they want whatever job you choose.

I usually take the first good offer if I’m new.

I then re-invest my income into building my skills so I can qualify for more difficult and higher-paying jobs.

There are more, but these are what we’re going to talk about in detail in the next lesson.
