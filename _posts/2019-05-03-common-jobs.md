The most common call center jobs are Customer Service, Sales and Tech Support.

There are different business processes being outsourced to the Philippines. 

Call center companies receive outsourcing requests and projects from multinational companies abroad and from small and medium enterprises.

Locally, call center companies are starting to accept call center projects from local companies and some local companies are now putting up their own internal call centers.

Call Center Jobs are solutions to problems so if you would like to accept a call center job you must first understand that you are providing solutions to a problem. 

At times the work will be uncomfortable (at first) or stressful (if you’re not doing the tasks correctly) but that’s why they pay you.

As professionals, we are paid to solve problems. 

What we can do to improve the situation is to try to improve ourselves bit by bit.

Here’s a shortlist of the most common call center jobs in the Philippines:


### Customer Service

Customer service agents often handle service requests, inquiries, follow-ups, complaints, etc.


### Technical Support

Technical support agents (or representatives)often handle troubleshooting, help desk requests that are mostly technical in nature or specific to certain technologies.

### Sales Representative

Sales agents or (representatives)handle the money-making aspect of the business where they offer solutions to clients or prospects in a form of products and services.

I personally believe that it’s a good idea to learn a bit about the three roles because one skill would complement the other. 

Customer service helps improve your patience and knowledge of different business processes.

Technical support helps you improve your product knowledge, analysis and problem solving skills.

Sales teaches you how to be persistent and become more convincing.

Remember that all these jobs can be both inbound or outbound.

### What should I choose?

If I'm new, I usually take the first good offer, then I re-invest my income into building my skills so I can qualify for more difficult and higher paying jobs.

There are more but these are what we’re going to talk about in detail on the next post.
