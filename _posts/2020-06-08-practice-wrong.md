Let's say that the English score needed to get hired in a call center is 100 points.

You can apply as many times as you want but for your English score, you need to get 100 points to get hired in a call center.

Here's the situation if you're a Filipino who studied in the Philippines before K-12.

- Pre School: Two years
- Grade School: Six Years
- High School: Four Years
- College: Four Years

Most Filipinos already studied grammar rules since the first grade.

That means, every year, you already went through parts of speech, grammar rules, reading, vocabulary at least ten times if you graduated from high school.

If you studied college or finished college, that's an additional four years.

If you graduated with K-12, you should have more practice.

You also had liklely seen at least thirty English movies and TV shows within that time period.

Based on experience, most Filipinos I've talked to already score within the range of 70 or 80 points.

With that in mind, our goal is just to teach them the missing 20 to 30 points so they can get hired.

If you decide to watch English movies, there's very little direction and focus on learning. 

Movies are intentionally 95% entertainment.

If you go read your old English textbooks, you begin studying lessons intended to teach people with zero English scores.

What usually happens with the book method is:

-  In an attempt to discover the missing 20 to 30 points, you'll read grade school or high school textbooks.
- You'll go through lessons that is intended to get your score from 0 to 70 or 80 points.
- The most frustrating part is...
- Since you already have this knowledge, you'll get bored or tired and as a result... 
- You don't get to discover the missing 20 to 30 points needed to get hired.
- Mission failed.

And if you are one of the few extreme cases of learners that are abnormally super motivated and you go through the lessons non-stop until you learn what you need to learn, you'll end up spending too much time and miss a lot of opportunities.

The best way is by getting you to write and speak to express yourself.

When you do this, we discover the specific 20 to 30 missing points needed to get hired.

We ask our students to do writing activities so they can practice:

- Introducing themselves.
- Talking about their personal preferences, career goals, and plans.
- Asking questions.
- Giving instructions.
- Tellling stories.

We ask our students to write about the above topics and as we read their writing activities together, we discover the missing 20 to 30 points that we need to fix.

In a lot of cases, when teaching our students, we only end up fixing twenty to thirty mistakes.

That's exactly how we help our students improve their English in six weeks or less.
