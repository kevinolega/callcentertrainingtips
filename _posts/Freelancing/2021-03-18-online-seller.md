Selling products online is a common source of income during the pandemic. 

Unfortunately, many recruiters don't consider "online seller" as job experience. 

Instead of saying online seller, here's what to say instead.

Instead of saying "I'm an online seller."

You can say:

"I have a part-time job managing a website/online store/Facebook page that sells clothes and accessories. I handle the sales, marketing, customer service, product purchasing and fulfilment."

This statement sounds more professional than "online seller."

Online seller is a "low-resolution description" of what you are doing.
