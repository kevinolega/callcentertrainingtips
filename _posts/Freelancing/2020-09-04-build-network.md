Want to become a business owner in the future?

How many of your close friends own a business?

Zero?

Okay.

Here's what you can do.

Buy from local businesses.

If you have someone selling on your Facebook and you're interested in what they're selling, buy from them.

Pay the full price.

Don't ask for discounts if you're close.

If you can't afford what they're selling, save money so you can pay for it in full.

Be kind and considerate to the business owner.

Support their business any way you can.

Share their posts.

Write a positive review.

Publicly share that their offer is in your wishlist.

Send clients and customers their way.

Do you know what happens next?

You've supported them.

Let's say in the future, and you're starting a small service, online store, blog, YouTube channel, or whatever.

Guess who's going to promote you next?

Those business owners that you helped out can help share your post with their friends.

Maybe that's not going to happen all the time.

But if you supported a dozen businesses, one or two might help you out.

Who can you confidently ask for business advice?

That business owner who became your friend is more likely going to spend time talking to you.

How did I build a successful blog?

I bought a few products from some bloggers while their blog was still small.

I asked for advice.

I followed the advice, and I thank them whenever I can.

If you want to receive support, go first.

Give support and receive support in the future.
