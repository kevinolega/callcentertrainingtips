FREELANCER VIDEO SCRIPT:

Hi my name is Kevin.

I'd like to audition for the position that you posted.

I shot this video to show you that I can speak English.

You won't have any problems with my grammar or accent.

I can be your point person for all online communications.

I work as a project manager and handle a small team of developers.

I previously handled a marketing support team.

We translated sales content from English to Spanish.

We edited photos, videos, and digital products.

I worked as a Virtual Assistant.

I'm a content writer for different CrossFit and Fitness related websites.

I also worked as a Technical Support Representative for a US-based internet provider.

The best way to evaluate me is by talking to me.

I look forward to hearing from you.

I also understand if you're busy and wouldn't have time to reply.

Thanks for watching!
