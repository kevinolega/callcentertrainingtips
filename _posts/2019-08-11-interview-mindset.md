Read this out loud.

And read this everyday.

This also functions as a pronunciation assessment.

This has TH, B & V, P & F sounds.

After you master this assessment, procede to [the Ultimate Self Confidence Formula](https://callcentertrainingtips.com/confidence-formula).

I am looking for work.

NOT I am begging for work.

I am looking for work.

And your company is interesting.

I'd like to work here.

I'm confident that I have something valuable to contribute.

And I'm excited about the opportunity.

But if it's not a match.

Then no hard feelings.

Let's just get on with the interview.

Because there is only one way to find out.

I'm also interested in knowing about my skills.

And discover what I need to improve.

So go ahead and evaluate my performance.

And please give me some feedback.

So I can build a stronger professional career.

I'm really excited for you to let me know what's wrong with me.

I'll ask you specific questions to collect the exact details.

Because vague answers won't do.

Then I'll direct my resources to resolving the issue.

And don't worry. 

I'll come back.

As a better professional.

I trust the process.

Because this path is the exact same path.

Of thousands of successful professionals.

I trust the process.

One hundred percent.

The law of sowing and reaping.

I will reap.

What I sow.

It also says.

If I sow.

Then I will reap.

Now let's get this straight.

If I want you.

And you want me.

Then let's work together.

If that's not the case.

Then that's perfectly okay as well.

But since we're both here.

Let's have a fun conversation.
