When you become an adult, this is what life becomes.

You can do whatever you want.

You have benefits, you can't get as kids.

But you have responsibilities.

You have bills to pay.

You need to pay your debts.

You buy your own food.

You will pay for rent.

If you fuck someone and get them pregnant, you will need to pay child support.

Or you will go to jail.

Or the bank will take your car or your house.

Or you will go hungry in the streets.

Life is difficult.

Life is also exciting if you are responsible.

Stop acting like a kid.
