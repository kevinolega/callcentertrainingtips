The first sign you have a great plan for your life is when everybody around you is opposing you.

There is resistance.

You will begin to feel lazy.

You will not feel like spending on your goal.

Your time and money will go to bullshit expenses.

Your friends and family will try to convince you to stay the same.

I built the life that I want because I didn't listen.

If I listened, I'd probably still be in a low paying mall job today
