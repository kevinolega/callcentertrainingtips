Before we begin, I want to share the following.

I am also guilty of watching this media from illegal sources.

I often recommended anime in the past because people are introducing themselves properly in the first few episodes.

So this is a great form of inspiration for learning how to introduce yourself in job interview situations.

I have overcome depressing moments in my life watching anime.

I have also learned a positive attitude and mindsets that allowed me to overcome obstacles through lessons from my favorite anime characters.

## Life Lessons From Anime

- Naruto Uzumaki taught me to never give up on your dream. Even if it's big and stupid.
- Kakashi Hatake taught me that learning many skills can make an ordinary person extraordinarily powerful. 
- Orochimaru taught me that even if I feel that life does not have any meaning if I stay alive long enough, I'll find something interesting.
- Shikamaru taught me to plan and execute.
- Shikaku (Shikamaru's dad) taught me that running away from responsibility will not improve my situations and that failure gives me the experience to increase my probability of success.
- Guts (Berserk) taught me to keep going forward no matter how hard life gets and to direct all my negative emotions to positive ends. And that new companions are always positive because you can't do everything alone. Doesn't matter how much of a badass you are.
- Keima Katsuragi (World God Only Knows)taught me that true enjoyment comes from overcoming difficult games without cheating.
- Onoda Sakamichi (Yowamushi Pedal) taught me that smiling and singing helps you overcome the most difficult tasks that everybody complains about.
- Shinji Ikari (Neon Genesis Evangelion) taught me to face life not through a mask (his identity as Eva Unit 01's pilot) but as myself.
- Yui Hirasawa (K-On) taught me that if you're sincere, no matter how clumsy or unskilled you are, you can change your life over time. See first episode and last episode.
- Takanashi Yomi (DeadMaster - Black Rock Shooter) taught me that everyone has internal struggles.
- Itachi Uchiha taught me to accept myself and my weakness and to build my life contributing my strength and overcoming my weakness through the cooperation of my allies.
- Saitou Hajime (Rurouni Kenshin - Samurai X) taught me that the best jobs are the ones people don't like doing.
- BK201 (Darker than Black) and Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Beebop) taught me that you can't fully live your life with one eye on your past.
- Baki Hanma (Grappler Baki) taught me the value of training everyday.
- Yujiro Hanma "Ogre" (Grappler Baki) taught me the value of physical fitness.
- Sato Kazuma (Kono Suba) taught me everything that you have no matter how much you hate it, is there for you to overcome life challenges.
- Natsuki Subaru (Re: Zero) taught me that if you learn from your mistakes, you can create the future that you want.
- Shiore (Log Horizon) taught me the value of strategy.
- Shido (Date-A-Live) taught me that befriending, not destroying your demons will allow you to ride them into battle. And being mindful of people's happiness level.
- Jokyuu (AIKI) taught me that to get better at my craft, I need to spend time with people who are best at what I do. Even if they all intimidate me.
- The characters of Cells at Work taught me how cells in my bodywork. It's very educational.
- Kei Asai (Sakurada Reset) taught me that in order to accomplish the impossible, you must strive for the outcome that gives all the parties involved what they truly desire.
- Saitama (One Punch Man) taught me the value of consistency.
- Harem anime main characters that know how to cook and being dependable as well as intelligent and physically fit will make it easier for you to build a harem. I mean find a partner. I mean connect with the best girl.

I've watched all these shows, usually by going two or three days straight until I've seen all the episodes, all the movies, OVA, read all the Wikipedia page, trivia and production notes of these shows.

I'm a true otaku. 

Or at least, I consider myself to be.

I am also a poor otaku. 

That is why I have very little anime merch growing up.

And I have a shitload of anime merch now that my income has increased.

## Life Lessons From K-Drama

I have, to some extent feel motivated to face a life struggle with a scene from a K-Drama.

- Crown Prince Yi-Chang (Kingdom) taught me that poor nutrition makes people weak.
- Jang Yum (Jewel in the Palace) taught me the value of patience.
- Park Si-on (Good Doctor) taught me to make the best from your situation and to focus on your advantages instead of your weaknesses.
- Coffee Prince taught me about Kimchi Rice. That's all I remember from this show.
- Weightlifting Fairy taught me that anyone can lift weights. It's not just a guy thing.

## Why You Should Stop Watching Anime and K-Drama

Most of the time you watch Anime and K-Drama posted on illegal streaming sites.

Some are watching some form of pirated media.

Some are watching shows illegally uploaded on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.

If it's not an official source, then something is wrong with you.

Specifically your situation.

I am guilty of this too.

I now have a Netflix subscription.

And watch my anime and occasionally K-Drama on Netflix.

Here's the thing.

## Consequences of a Poverty Mindset

If you can't pay for the anime, you are not supporting the creators.

**But these people are already rich.**

Yes.

The problem is... 

What does that make you?

You're stealing.

And making it part of your life to believe it's okay to steal from someone rich.

And it's okay for poor people to steal from the rich.

You are not saying it.

But your ACTIONS are SCREAMING it.

So when you begin to make that sweet, sweet call center money, your family and friends will raise their hands and ask for your handouts.

Libre mo ko cheeseburger.

Libre mo ko sangyupsal.

Libre mo ko ng milk tea.

Sooner or later, you already received ONE MILLION PESOS in a call center from your paycheck.

But you have ZERO savings.

*NOTE: one million pesos is only 20k for five years. Not counting your thirteenth month and bonuses.*

But that's not your biggest problem.

## The biggest problem watching Anime and K-Drama on pirated media is...

You do not have the money to pay for it.

I mean, yes you can pay for it.

You can ask your parents.

Or you can make a sacrifice to pay for it.

But you are NOT at the income level where you are comfortable paying for things.

This means you are still POOR.

This means you are WASTING your time.

You can, instead, be WORKING HARD to get promoted.

You can, instead, be STUDYING HARD to develop your skills.

Your TIME can go to something worthwhile.

Your time can be INVESTED in upgrades that MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER.

Instead of being WASTED on entertainment.

And that's the thing.

I pay for things now.

Because I can pay for things now.

And more importantly...

Because I see the value of time and money.

Watching anime and K-Drama is a good reward for a job well done.

Not an activity that should STEAL ALL YOUR OPPORTUNITIES IN LIFE.

When we were younger, our parents taught us that entertainment is something we're allowed after we're DONE ACCOMPLISHING OUR RESPONSIBILITIES.

As kids, we didn't watch TV, see a movie or play a game until after we've cleaned up, eaten dinner, done homework and brush our teeth.

Why do the opposite now that you're old.

Which of the two options make you feel like a winner or a LOSER?
