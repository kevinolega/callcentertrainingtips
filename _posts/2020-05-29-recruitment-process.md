Getting hired in a call center has multiple stages.

American companies are hiring Filipinos to represent their company.


## Online Application

You typically send your resume to a recruiter and fill out an online form like.

Requires: Resume.

## Walkin Application

For walk-in applications, you go to a company and apply.

Many call center companies have a one day process and can complete the recruitment screening process on the spot.

Requires: Printed Resume, ID, Pen and Notebook.

## Computer Exam

Some companies will require you to input your information into their computer instead of filling out a paper application form.

You may also encounter a basic English test, business English test, basic math test, basic computer knowledge test, and a typing test.

There are companies who do Versant or Berlitz to test your listening skills and check your pronunciation through a recording program on the computer.

Requires: Basic computer knowledge, typing speed 25-35 words per minute.

## Initial Interview

You will be asked to talk about yourself and your professional experience.

You will be asked about your career story, goals and plans.

Most common questions are:

- Tell me about yourself.
- What are your strengths and weakness.
- Why do you want to work in a call center and why should we hire you.

Pro Tip: You need to practice telling stories about what happened to you instead of copying other people's interview answers.

## Group or Panel Interview

Group interviews can happen in the initial phase and in the final phase.

The questions in the group interview are generally the same.

Sometimes, the group interview is one applicant, multiple interviewers.

Sometimes it's one interviewer and multiple applicants.

Sometimes it's multiple applicants and multiple interviewers.

If you can handle one interviewer, you can handle multiple interviewers.

I like group interviews because it gives me an idea of what to say and what NOT to say during the interview.

I observe everybody's answer and I pay attention to who passes and fails.

This helps me avoid making big mistakes because I know more of exactly what NOT to do during the interview.

## Written Exam

Sometimes, you have basic English tests that are multiple choice, fill in the blanks and enumeration.

You are also given essays where you're asked to give step by step instructions for a customer service situation or you are asked to tell a story.

## Call Simulation

During call simulation, you are going to role-play.

The interviewer will be the customer and you will be the customer service or sales representative.

For customer service and tech support, the task will involve greeting the customer and assisting them with their problem.

For sales, the task will involve selling a product or service over the phone.

Please familiarize yourself with the different call flows that we posted here on the site.
