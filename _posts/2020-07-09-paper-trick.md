My boss taught me a paper trick that changed my life.

First, he gave me an index card.

Next, he asked me to write down the following letters:

	A 
	P

After writing down the two letters, he gave me the definition.

AP can mean Always Positive.

AP can also mean Attitude Problem.

I wrote down always positive on one side.

I also wrote attitude problem on the other side.

He asked me to check regularly which AP is in charge of my mind and body.

Everytime things are going out of control, I should pull out my small index card and decide which side should be facing up.

Are you drowning in an attitude problem?

Or are you always positive?
