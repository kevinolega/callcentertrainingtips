Back in 2008, I applied for a job at a recruitment company.

I'm applying for a corporate sales position.

The boss who interviewed me seemed intelligent and interesting.

He also grew up playing games and also followed the Naruto series.

After building rapport, the conversation went to my business skills.

His first question was...

## Are you comfortable presenting to clients in English?

I said yes.

He then asked me...

## On a scale of 1-10 how would you rate your English communication skills?

I told him that I consider myself a seven out of ten.

## What's a 7? How would you describe a level seven communicator?

I thought for a few seconds to put together how, I'd describe my communication skills.

I can have a conversation in English.

I can prospect in English.

I am comfortable telemarketing in English.

I can present our products and services in English.

I can give instructions and explain things in English.

I've sold things to English speaking clients.

I told the interviewer.

The interviewer smiled and asked me a follow up question.

## What's an 8? Why are you not an eight?

I thought for an answer a little longer than the previous question.

An eight is someone who's really good at communicating in English.

They're really good at convincing others.

They explain things really well.

They can transform complex explanations into really simple explanations that anyone can follow and are also able to discuss the complex details in English.

My current goal is to get from a level seven to a level eight.

Usually the people I've met who are level eight are top sellers, managers, professionals and business owners that I've met.

Many priests, pastors and religious leaders are also at level eight.

These people are charismatic, persuasive and have attractive personalities.

That's interesting, my interviewer told me.

If that's how you describe an eight...

## What's a 9 or 10?

I thought for a minute.

No answer.

I used my favorite stalling technique.

That's an interesting question.

I'll need a minute to compose my thoughts.

I told him, that's the first time I've been asked that question.

I've never really considered that.

I've always thought about exactly where I am and where I want to go next.

I learned from my previous sales manager that hitting short term goals consistently usually guarantee succeeding with the long term goals.

It's difficult question.

Can we try another question and I'll get back to you when I come up with an answer?

I really don't have an answer for this right now.

He said okay and we continued our interview.

I eventually got hired.

But the memory of this question stayed with me and I realized there's an important lesson so I kept trying to recall this event so I can get the lesson.

## What does someone from 1-5 like?

## Prison Frustration Violence

## What's a 9?

## What's a 10?
