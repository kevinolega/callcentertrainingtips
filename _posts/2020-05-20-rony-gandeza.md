Alternate point of view.

Rony Gandeza is an operations director for Teleperformance, one of the largest BPO companies in the country.

For the past year, I have noticed his posts being shared on my feed.

Rony shares practical and actionable advice on how to improve your life.

He doesn't seem to have a blog or a public Facebook page, instead, he just uses his personal Facebook profile to host his written thoughts and sets his tiny blog posts to public.

He seems to be speaking to an audience of BPO workers, young professionals and aspiring call center agents.

I noticed that his words are followed by people I looked up to.

I like his posts and point of view.

He was popular for "Apologizing to Manny Pacquiao" and specifies how "Many Filipinos Act Like Pigs."

I regret not being able to read all of posts because I believe there is so much to learn from the man.

There's not a lot of Filipino BPO workers sharing ideas on how to advance and the fact that he's not a professional blogger or a YouTuber but an actual person who advanced from an entry level post to a management role makes his topics a breath of fresh air.

He encourages people to stay disciplined and sometimes consider the management point of view so they can qualify for advancement.

He also began posting videos to expand the range of his content.

A few days ago, he received thousands of abusive comments from several Filipinos who "missed the point" about a story that he shared on a video.

Several of the bashers even went as far as doxxed him and attempted to defame him by going after his employers.

I'm going to tell the story and I'm going to share different points of view to consider.

I listened to the video again and again, to see if it was I who missed the point. 

I almost transcribed the video to make sure I got all the important details.

Story follows...

### The Interview Story:

Rony was assigned to conduct a final interview for an applicant for a senior management position.

It was casual Friday, he was just wearing jeans and a tshirt.

He waited for the person to arrive at the lobby/waiting area and started a conversation.

The applicant arrives wearing a coat and tie, dressed to impress.

He didn't introduce himself yet.

He asked if the person was an applicant.

The applicant said yes without looking at him.

The applicant was just looking straight at the wall.

He asked the applicant what position he was applying for.

The applicant said "I'm applying for a senior management role" while directly looking ahead.

He then asked the applicant what school he came from in order to start a natural conversation.

The applicant said the name of his very prestigious school without looking at Rony.

The applicant answered three questions without looking at the Rony.

Not even once.

The applicant then stood up and went to the other side of the couch and pulled up a magazine and covered his face.

This is a classic "shut up and don't talk to me position."

Rony finally found the applicant rude so he then moved toward the applicant and introduced himself.

He said his name, his title and informed the guy that he'll conduct the final interview.

The applicant was shocked because he was rude to the wrong person.

Rony described the applicant's face turning red.

They then had the interview.

The usual conversation ensues. 

The applicant discusses his background and experience.

The applicant discusses his analytical skills.

The applicant is impressive and he also has a full American accent.

On paper and during the interview, the applicant is "fit for the role."

That's not everything that you need to fulfill during the job hunting process.

Rony asked a question that I've encountered when I applied for several sales positions.

"How determined are you to get this position?"

The applicant said he's really determined.

So he's asked "Are you willing to sing just to get the position? "

The applicant said "yes."

The applicant sang and dance at the production floor like a good sport.

Rony asked two more questions. I'm curious what these are.

After the applicant left, Rony began to think if he will hire the guy or not.

Rony decided not to.

Rony later discussed how the incident in the lobby is a big consideration because what stuck is how the applicant treated people whom he perceives as having no authority.

He later explains how it's easy to be nice to your boss and discuss different leadership principles.

The lesson that stood out is how it is important to factor in the character of the person.

> "Our character is revealed by how we mistreat the people we are allowed to mistreat." - David Sedaris

He described the applicant as a good looking guy who came from a nice school and has a masters degree in management with very impressive credentials.

I suspect he used this as a story telling technique to help the audience picture the applicant.

Several Filipino netizens reacted negatively.

It appears that all people remembered was that the applicant is "good looking" and he was "given a difficult time" during the interview and was eventually rejected.

## Observations.

The applicant appears to be a good hire "on paper" based on the story.

There are several reasons why a manager will not hire someone for a role.

There are factors like culture fit, personality fit, teamwork and so on.

#### Interview Preparation Alibi - Debunked

I've read several bashers justify the rude behavior because "the applicant is nervous and is preparing for a job interview."

Job interviews are "nerve-wracking" experiences.

In the event that I'm in an interview and I'm worried that I need to prepare, if someone is talking to me, I may politely excuse myself, admit that I'm nervous and go prepare.

It was mentioned several times that the applicant was answering questions but kept avoiding eye contact.

If you’re unable to communicate the outcome that you want to happen, you have no business applying for a senior management position.

If the applicant is unprepared, he has no business going to the interview and apply for a management position.

#### Making the Job Applicant Sing and Dance is Foul - Debunked

For sales, marketing and management roles, it is common practice to make an applicant sing and/or dance in front of the team.

This happened at four of 6 of the sales jobs that I've been to.

#### The Guy Was Wearing a Coat and Tie

He's wearing jeans and tshirt.

Back when I was applying for differnt jobs, I was advised that everyone I meet on the company premises is potentially a decision maker.

I had the opposite experience.

I had a chat over three cigarettes with a nice looking gentleman who appears to be in his thirties who was also wearing torn jeans, scruffy shoes and tshirt.

He gave me a bunch of interview tips and ideas on how to answer some interview questions over three sticks of cigarettes.

He even gave me one.

I had no idea that he will be my second interviewer for the company.

Apparently he was the HR head.

#### Physical Attractiveness is a Factor in the story- Debunked

The format of the post is a video of a person telling a story.

Since we’re not there, it’s Rony’s job to describe the applicant.

The applicant is a good looking well dressed man who obviously studied in a nice school.

The purpose of this description is to help the listener imagine what is going on in the story. 

Talking to the person pre-interview does not mean hidden agenda.

The reason the word “attractive” was used is for story-telling purpose.

There is also no reason for arguing about ego being hurt or insecurity. 


### Applicant's Red Flags:

#### Not Looking At The Person Talking To You Has More Negative Points Than You Think

The applicant is applying for a senior management position.

What is a manager?

A manager is a steward of the company.

The business owner entrusts the welfare of the company with a manager. 

A senior manager has higher responsibilities.

In a lot of situations, senior managers are put in charge of fifty to a hundred employees.

### So what’s wrong with not looking?

#### Preparedness:

For higher tier positions, we are all expected to arrive prepared with all our research and notes before we got to the location.

#### Perception:

If you’re a senior manager, you are responsible for everything that happens to the business.

Your destiny is tied to the destiny of the company.

That’s just how it is.

That’s the reason you are paid five to ten times an entry level employee.

In the same way, everything is your fault. 

If a problem happens and you didn’t see it, it is still your fault.

The fact that he was unable to detect that Rony is the interviewer means there’s something wrong with his ability to pay attention.

#### Communication Skills:

Management requires that you communicate up and down the hierarchy.

The reason why Rony says he is good is because he can communicate up but he can’t communicate down the hierarchy.

That’s the reason why he didn’t get hired. 

If the applicant wanted privacy to prepare for his interview, did he ask politely or did he attempt to end the conversation without communicating his intentions?

I have worked with managers who did not communicate his plan to us because we were just subbordinates.

We got left in the dark because we didn't have any clear instructions.

Perhaps Rony is trying to avoid a similar experience.

#### Two-Faced Personality:

The candidate displayed a big personality change when being interviewed and introduced to the management compared to how he behaved in the lobby.

When you get hired, you represent the company all the time.

Once you enter company premises and you're about to have your final interview, you should expect that every person you meet in the company is potentially part of your job application process.

#### Team and Culture Fit

In management, we get assigned people that we like and we don't like and we are required to achieve our targers and make the relationship work.

In BPO scenarios, teams and groups get shuffled around.

So being a snot to some random dude you don't know may backfire if that person ever becomes a team member.

When I worked for West Contact Services, most Team Leaders helped me when I was starting out and as a benefit, we got to work well together when I got assigned to them. 


#### Mindfulness

If you go to a company, everyone you meet inside the building is potentially someone who has a say if you get hired or get rejected.

How you talk to a security guard or receptionist may be a good reason to reject you.



Hiring managers have the authority to make decisions.

People with the ability to make hiring decisions are often given explicit intstuctions to "trust their gut"
 
The main reason why HR and management many forms of psychological questions and tests is to discover potential deal breakers as early as possible.

Once a person gets hire for a job, the company is liable to paying them.

When a person becomes a manager they no longer have official on and off time. 

There is no separation between personal and business hours.

This is a senior management applicant on a final interview.

This is not a newbie job applicant that got bullied.

3. You seated in the couch waited for your interviewee and by the time he arrived you did not introduce yourself? Which relates to point #2 (Hidden Agenda)

4. You started a small conversation to someone who was there for a formal interview, focused and maybe there's still alot in his mind how to answer questions in appropriate ways. And yet, there you are testing his interpersonal skills by engaging fun talk and require him to respond to you based on your own perspective?

5. I do not know you sir and I don't agree with the way you humiliated the guy. Even before the actual interview, you already decided not to hire him (fact), and yet you go beyond your power to ask him sing and dance infront of the crowd? Can I say the F word infront of your not so pleasing face?

6. Your kind of personality I don't admire. You're judgemental, power tripper and yes, you have high regards to your self. The video itself speaks what kind of person are you. Talking to people with a mug? Stating a mesirable act you did while seeing a smile in your face? Duh!

7. You might wanna consider Johari Window technique for improving YOUR self-awareness. Maybe it will help you understand your relationship with yourself and others. You're a boss, and not a leader by example.

## Hateful Comments


I read a comment by an HR practicioner saying:

Andrew De Dios, 

Buti pa ko nun sa recruitment pg bet khit attitude pasok na agad. 🤣

Many of the peole are using inauthentic accounts and are hiding under a pseudonym.

Domz Pecos has 9 friends and only has a photo of a scooter.


Fhyn Liyoc has a history of just cyberbullying people she disagrees with.




Hiring managers are not interested in your interview answers because 90% of our interview answers are designed to make us look good. Hiring managers are interested in what kind of person you are. They want to know how you respond to situations that are not part of your practiced script so they can decide to hire you or not.


### Disclaimer:

When I was younger, I probably hated 90% of how management made their decisions, however, as I got older and held more responsibilities, I noticed that about half of the practices that I strongly disagreed with began to make more sense.

### My opinion.

Good looking guy from a prestigious school.

That's a description to make you imagine what the person looked like.

What kind of victory do you seek?

Do you want the person to get publicly humiliated, fired or lose economic opportunities?

Do you want the person to feel emotional pain as payback for the "good looking applicant" who didn't get hired?

I did some research about making an applicant sing or dance during an interview.

Here's what I found.

One Employer Said:

We want rock stars who do whatever it takes to get the job done with enthusiasm.

They wanted to see how you react under pressure and on your feet. You don't say what the job is but I imagine it's probably something where you're speaking with members of the public and believe me, they will ask you very random questions.

I once attended an interview for a well known toy store and everyone there was given a random toy and told to sell it. Some people just sat in their chair and basically read off the box, some others stood up and pretended they were on one of those television shopping channels and the rest (me included) did somewhere in the middle. Not one person who stayed sitting and reading got the job.

I don't use tactics like that unless I am interviewing for a high visibility, high stress position.

When I do, the purpose is to see how you behave under stress. For one candidate, I asked him a series of obscure questions that nobody should be able to answer. He couldn't answer one correctly, but he did say that he would look it up, or ask someone. This was for a position where his work would show up in a major newspaper. I didn't want a know-it-all, I wanted someone who would stop and check when he wasn't sure. This was a big deal because any mistakes would have been seen by millions.

If the position you are in isn't high visibility, or high risk, this is still not the employer thinking any less of you, but instead bad management decisions where someone heard about a new thing this group that a friend of a friend tried...

Soooo, no it doesn't mean that they're not taking you seriously, but it could be a red flag for bad management if the position you are applying for isn't one where stress and high pressure situations are the norm.

They may be taking it seriously but not know how to conduct a good interview, or they may be looking for how you react to surprise and stress.(Or both.) They almost certainly are not just amusing themselves at your expense. Personally, I would either shrug and comply, then ask why the request was made ... or ask them why first and discuss from there.

When you say "personnel work" I'm assuming you'd be working for HR. HR positions in a lot of organizations will include some aspects of leading "company mandated fun". If HR for this organization is the driver for wacky, moral building exercises or some such nonsense then your ability to let loose and be willing to step out of your serious shoes is something that should be determined in the interview.

As an example, recently I heard about one branch of my organization (a fertilizer manufacturer) that involved finger painting in the relaunch of our company values statement. If your role will likely be one that includes getting industrial mechanics to finger paint, the person to fill that role legitimately needs to be someone who is comfortable being goofy.

Lots of different roles will need someone who is relaxed and willing to take social risks. Tasks like this in the interview can weed out those who freeze up at that sort of risk. They serve the same purpose as technical questions in an interview for a technical role.

It's not unheard of that interviewers, especially when interviewing for management positions, put their applicants on the spot, stress them out, try to see how they react under pressure.

One (not very good) way of doing that is by making ridiculous requests.

There's some business purpose to this, or at least the interviewer thinks so.

Some talents are easy to capture in an interview. If you're interviewing to be a drafter, questions about your proficiency in AutoCAD (or a similar product) are quite reasonable and help quantify your ability to do the job. However, some talents (typically so called "soft skills") are much harder to test. Sometimes the interviewer wants to see what's underneath the veneer you put on when you entered the interview.

Frankly, no matter what job you are interviewing for, you're going to be put into positions that put pressure on you. They can't test for those specific scenarios because they simply don't know what they will be. Each person's career pits them against different challenges. Instead they have to test for generic skills. One of the effective approaches for testing these skills is to ask questions that are outside of the "comfort zone," forcing you to dig deep.

One famous question is from Google, asking about the resistance between two points on an infinite grid of 1 ohm resistors. This particular problem was very popular on the internet a while back as people looked for solutions to it. However, the purpose of the question was not to see who could get the right answer. It was to give an opportunity for the interviewer to see how you approached such problems. How did you structure your work? Did you get frustrated? All of these are very hard to quantify, and even harder to bake into one single numerical metric, but a skilled interviewer can glean a remarkable amount of information just by watching you operate in such a stressful environment.

As for the task seeming to be "unrelated" to what you are interviewing for, it might indeed be unrelated. However, you may be surprised at how interrelated soft skills can be. As you work the job (assuming you get hired), you may learn to appreciate why that particular test was related.

In an interview with an ex-Blue Man Group actor, I came across a similar interview test for clowns. The test was simple. The clown walked on stage in front of a group of people, said nothing, did nothing. They stood there. When they felt they had made meaningful contact with at least one person, they walked off stage. Given that clowns are almost never just standing still like that, the test might seem unrelated. However, if you dig deeper into the job and understand what a clown actually has to do to accomplish their job, that particular test was surprisingly relevant. Also, if you asked anyone to quantify the results of that test, they would chuckle at you and say "that's not how it works, pal."

You can approach such a question may ways. You can jump into it with both feet, and belt out your best Sinatra, or maybe some Go Go's. Or decide not to let the question touch you at all and instead choose a nice rousing round of "Row Row Row your boat," while gathering yourself to answer the next question perfectly. Or perhaps you ask for clarification as to why you are being asked to sing. The ability to politely ask for clarification at the right moments is a highly prized skill in business. It's a skill that can save millions if applied at the correct moment.

Any way you choose to treat it, the purpose of these curveball questions is to get to see a side of you that would not show past the thin veneer we put on when we go to an interview. It's a side that will get out if you get the opportunity to work 9-5 for several years with these people, so they might as well get to know what they're in for! Let them see what you will bring to the table after all those years.


Another possibility is that they could be assessing you as a cultural fit for the company. This is more likely in a smaller company, where fitting in with your team and colleagues is often more of a priority.

I'm not saying that the company is likely to hold regular lunchtime karaoke competitions, but it may be a popular teambuilding activity on work nights out for them, or something similar.

At one company I previously worked at a common interview question they asked was something along the lines of:

"If you were at a company function and you were asked to dance on a table, would you?"

They didn't mind whether the candidate would or would not dance on the table, just that they didn't come across as overly 'corporate' or disapproving. They were looking for a reaction which suggested that the candidate would fit in at company functions and with the rest of the team in general. Their reasoning for asking that specific question was that someone at the company had previously actually danced on a table at a company function!

I can't say whether this is what happened here, but I don't think being asked to sing is necessarily a sign of them not taking your application seriously.

As the previous answers have stated, yes, they're assessing your personality. This is what I've always known as a 'curveball question' where the interviewer tries to shake you up and see how you react.

From my experience they're fairly common (at least in the UK), and I've had anything from "If you were a fruit, what fruit would you be and why?" to "Can you give me 3 uses for a coat hanger other than hanging clothes?"

It's about confidence and how well you can think on your feet a lot of the time.

By the way, I hope you get the job!

https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/84670/if-you-were-asked-to-sing-or-do-other-weird-things-at-a-job-interview-does-this/84673

Several years ago another young boss was roasted, bashed and mobbed for sharing to the masses the exact steps on how to get from a lower position and qualify for a higher position.

Several middle managers and entry level staff didn't like what he said so they got him fired.


Matthew 25

40And the King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me.’

41Then He will say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink, 43I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, I was naked and you did not clothe Me, I was sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.’

44And they too will reply, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?’

45Then the King will answer, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for Me.’

46And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”


People are saying they'll hire the guy.

Are you willing to spend 400k to a million pesos to give a chance to an applicant who treated the final interviewer that way?


The guy just told you a story that teaches you how to qualify for a leadership role and the Filipinos he's trying to help ended up mobbing him and forced him to shut down his personal Facebook account.


Hans Christian Salcedo people in higher positions are often given more challenging tests. When I worked in recruitment we were endorsing an IT Manager to a multinational company and the whole recruitment process was six months. The company has a rule that they need to select from 5 applicants. So obviously out of 5 4 yung rejected and all of them attended interviews for six months.

The job requires a CCIE certification and the budget for the salary is 350-450k/month.


My opinion.

Rony alread seemed to have a negative gut feel from the no eye contact part of the story but he kept attempting to continue the converations until he got the chance to introduce himself until the applicant walked away.

The applicant reached the final interview.

He passed all the previous interviews.

He had good credentials.

He had good skills.

But in the end, Rony had to decide.

The person was good on paper but not very good in person.

At least, not enough to justify hiring the person.

The applicant may be okay as far as "job fit" goes.

However, considering subtle tells that you see in an applicant is important too.

Will this person manage people well

What agenda will this person advance, his agenda, the company's agenda or the team's agenda?

Will he take credit for all the accomplishments or will he share the TK with his people?

Many of these questions are difficult to ask and often don't have a clearn answer.

People who make their final hiring decisions are asked to "trust their gut" in the end.

Rony probably had to write a report to why this applicant was rejected.

That's the reason why he felt comfortable sharing his experience.

I'm not 100% sure on this but I suspect that Rony is the hiring manager for this post.

So if he determines that what he saw from the applicant not talking to him properly at the reception area has more weight than the test scores and interview answers, then the decision is properly justified.

If the candidate gets hired and it's a wrong fit, the company is likely going to lose a minimum of 500k for hiring the wrong person.

Does being asked to sing and dance make you feel embarrased?



I wasn't present at this interview from ten years ago. 

So I'm not 100% on the facts.

I'm only sharing points based on experience.

These are what I understand from my job application experience and during the times when I was conducting interviews and working with different senior managers and executives who are making hiring decisions.

When I was younger I disagree with 90% of management practices but I kept quiet about it because I needed a job.

When I got older, I noticed that more than half of the things I disagree with begin to make sense.

I also have my own ego and biases.

I tend to side with the underdog.

I try to find a solution to a problem.

I also try to see what the other person is doing before I give my answer.
