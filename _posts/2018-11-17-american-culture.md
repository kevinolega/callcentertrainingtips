When you turn eightieen in the US or other English speaking country:

1. You are considered an adult and responsible for your own life. 
2. You need to get your own income.
3. You need to get out of the house and into your own place.
4. You need to pay for your own education if you would like to go to a university.

Very few people in other English speaking countries live with their parients.

In these countries, everyone is expected to be independent.

### Filipino Culture

Filipinos however, are dependent on their family for almost everything. 

In Filipino families, there is usually one (or a few) people who take on the role of the "breadwinner" the breadwinner is responsible for house bills, expenses, sending the next breadwinner to school, buying and maintaining the family TV, computer, etc.

In the Philippines, the parent is responsible for college education and for supporting the offspring until they have a good income.

Later on, this cycle repeats in the opposite and the parent becomes dependent on the offspring.

Very few Filipinos are capable of being independent.

This cycle sounds sweet but it's actually spoiled if you think about it carefully.

When you begin work, it's important to remember that one day, you are going to stop working because when you reach a certain age, employers are no longer interested in hiring you.

So it's important to save for retirement because expenses will continue.

Your Filipino parents, knows this well but instead of saving money for their future, the money is then invested in your future through your education.

Often, when one reaches thirty, you can be responsible for yourself, your parents and your children so it's many people depending on one income source.

This is why many Filipino families stay poor.

There is an "entitlement mentality" where one expects the parents to shoulder all expenses.

Here are some examples of situations that I've encountered.

1. I am a college student and my parent's pay for everything. Halfway through my course, I decided to shift to a new course because "I don't feel like pursuing my course anymore." My parents will then be obligated to pay for my extended year (or years) in college.
2. I am a college student and my parents are paying for my education. They are bareley making ends meet. But I got pregnant (or got someone pregnant). Now my parents have to pay for my childs expenses too.
3. I'm not studying because of a financial problem. My parents can't afford to send me to school. I just stay at home and help with the chores. I don't really do anything for income.

Are you the hero of your family or are you the burden?
