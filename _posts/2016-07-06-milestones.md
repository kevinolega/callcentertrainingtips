For a lot of people there are two states in life. Success and non success. So you set a goal, you work on the goal, you succeed. If you don't succeed, you fail. Sounds reasonable. It's not really. Consider this. If your goal is to learn how to get hired for your dream job, you go at it and if it's your first time you're going to fail at some point. What you need to identify is where? The better questions is at what milestone did you fail? Here are examples of mile stones in job hunting:

1.  **Online application**. You send out your resume. Are you getting phone interviews or invitations for in-person interviews? If you don't get calls, look at your resume. Make sure that it is well written, with no grammar and spelling errors, you have the correct contact information, you are highlighting your strengths and you are sending it to enough companies. Ten is too little. I usually send my resume out to 20 to 200 companies before I start getting interviews. If it's a call center job I just send it to everyone and I select from everyone who's interested. I usually go to the first interviews so I can use them for practice.
2.  **Phone interviews**. The first interaction with the company. If you pass, you get invited to the next step, which is usually an in person interview. If you fail you need to consider the following factors. Do you sound professional on the phone? Do you speak clearly? Is your voice loud enough? Are you standing up straight and smiling? Do you talk confidently? Were you able to communicate your strengths?
3.  **In person interviews**. This is where they will evaluate your communication skills, confidence, first impressions when it comes to your professionalism, and if you make a good employee. If you pass you will be endorsed to the next step. If you fail, consider the following factors. Was I able to introduce myself in English well? Was I able to answer the questions confidently, clearly and while smiling? Was I on time and presentable? Was I able to
4.  **Exam**.
5.  Mock Call or Call Simulation. 
6.  **Sales Test**. This doesn't happen on all interviews but depending on what kind of call center job or account they are hiring for this is important especially if you intend to become a manager in the future.
7.  Customer Service test. This doesn't happen on all interviews but depending on what kind of call center job or account they are hiring for this is important especially if you intend to become a manager in the future.
8.  Tech Support test. This doesn't happen on all interviews but depending on what kind of call center job or account they are hiring for this is important especially if you intend to become a manager in the future.
9.  Final interview. This is where the negotiations and the final decision often happens.
10.  Job offer.
