For a lot of people there are two states in life. You have “Success” and you have “non success.” 

So you set a goal, you work on the goal, you succeed. 

If you don't succeed, you fail. Sounds reasonable. It's not really. 

Consider this. If your goal is to learn how to get hired for your dream job, you go at it and if it's your first time you're going to fail at some point. What you need to identify is where? 

The better questions is at what milestone did you fail? 

Here are examples of mile stones in job hunting:

**1. Online application**. 

You send out your resume. Are you getting phone interviews or invitations for in-person interviews? If you don't get calls, look at your resume. Make sure that it is well written, with no grammar and spelling errors, you have the correct contact information, you are highlighting your strengths and you are sending it to enough companies. Ten is too little. I usually send my resume out to 20 to 200 companies before I start getting interviews. If it's a call center job I just send it to everyone and I select from everyone who's interested. I usually go to the first interviews so I can use them for practice.

**2. Phone interviews**. 

The first interaction with the company. If you pass, you get invited to the next step, which is usually an in person interview. If you fail you need to consider the following factors. Do you sound professional on the phone? Do you speak clearly? Is your voice loud enough? Are you standing up straight and smiling? Do you talk confidently? Were you able to communicate your strengths?

**3. In person interviews**. 

This is where they will evaluate your communication skills, confidence, first impressions when it comes to your professionalism, and if you make a good employee. If you pass you will be endorsed to the next step. If you fail, consider the following factors. Was I able to introduce myself in English well? Was I able to answer the questions confidently, clearly and while smiling? Was I on time and presentable? Was I able to

**4. Exam**.

Exams are often boring, you’re probably going to take some English exams, a little grammar, a little reading and comprehension. You’ll read stories and answer some questions related to the story. You’ll do some IQ tests. You’ll probably answer some basic computer use test like how to start a computer, how to Google and stuff like that. This is incredibly boring. Some companies have this and some companies skip this. Call center exams are just easy and repetitive. When you go to about ten call center you will notice that a lot of the exam questions are very similar.

**5.  Mock Call or Call Simulation.**

So depending on the account that you will be assigned to or what account the call center you went to is hiring for, you will be assigned to do a mock call. A mock call is a practice call for the job. Here are three situations that are common.
- Sell something to the customer.
- Receive a call from the customer and process their request.
- How to handle an irate customer.
- How to assist a customer do something on their smartphone or computer.

For more information about this, my blog has several tips on how to handle these situations.

**6.Sales Test**. 
This doesn't happen on all interviews but depending on what kind of call center job or account they are hiring for this is important especially if you intend to become a manager in the future.

**7. Customer Service test**. 

This doesn't happen on all interviews but depending on what kind of call center job or account they are hiring for this is important especially if you intend to become a manager in the future.

**8. Tech Support test.**
  
This doesn't happen on all interviews but depending on what kind of call center job or account they are hiring for this is important especially if you intend to become a manager in the future.

**9. Final interview**. 

This is where the negotiations and the final decision often happens. Often, final interview questions are related to confirming how well you are a job fit:
- Are you okay working weekends, shifting schedules, holidays, night-shift, graveyard shift etc?
- Are you confident you will report to work on time all the time?
- Are you committed to work on improving your English even further?
- Are you committed to do your best at the job?
- Are you okay with the salary they are offering?
- and so on..

It is important to ask questions at this point.
- Can you tell me what a typical workday looks like for your agents?
- Can you share some unique perks that I should be excited about?
- Can you give me some tips on how to do well in this account?
- What are the traits your top performers have in common?
- What is the most common reason why an agent would not do well in this job?
- What do you think are the two improvements that I should focus on?
- and so on.

Asking questions in an interview will help you start a conversation with your interviewer. Use any of these but not all at the same time to guarantee that you will pass your final interview. You can use these questions at any interview.


**10.  Job offer.**

So they’ll show you the contract along with your pay. Be sure to read the contract and make sure all the details are clear to you.
You can take notes to remember the key points and to identify questions that you want to ask them about later. 

If you reach this point, congratulations. You need to buy me a cheeseburger.
