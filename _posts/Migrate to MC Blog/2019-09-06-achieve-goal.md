I really enjoyed and learned a lot from this video by Stephen Duneier.

Watch this everytime you feel a goal is too big or impossible.

If you can fill a paper with gray, you can draw a realistic version of the face of Brad Pitt with just a pencil and a piece of paper.

One square is one pixel in a giant image assembled together.

This is project management. (Note from Kevin)

A marginal improvement in your progress can have a dramatic improvement in your results.

Top Tennis Player

- 49% points won, 49% matches won, Rank 100+ earns $0.3m
- 52% points won, 79% matches won, Rank 3 earns $5m
- 55% points won, 90% matches won, Rank 1 earns $14m

Goal is to just increase by 6% from an average top performer to the number one player.

What can I achieve in 5-10 minutes at a time?

If you're not achieving your goal you're working with a bigger task and haven't broken it down to the workable size.

Person listened to 99 German CD's using his commute and became proficient in German.

What are you doing with your commute time?

Guy uses minimal changes. Something I figured in 2008.

Put down your Facebook and do something better with your life.

Make the decision while on the couch.

Read one word.

Set a goal for skills.

Set a goal for personal accomplishments.

Take a big goal.

Break it down to the tiniest step.

Make marginal improvements to your routine.

"The secret to getting ahead is getting started"
