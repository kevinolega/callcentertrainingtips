If you have difficulty writing...

When you're stuck, take a break and continue later.

You should write when you're relaxed.

It's challenging to write when you're tense.

From personal experience, you should be relaxed in the morning.

I tried writing in the morning.

Writing is the first thing that I do.

I try to get as much writing done before I respond to emails and social media.

If I start in the middle of the day, it becomes tough for me to write.

So if you're stuck with your writing when you try writing at night.

Consider writing in the morning.
