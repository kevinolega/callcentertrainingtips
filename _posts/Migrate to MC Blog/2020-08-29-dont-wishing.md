You won't get better by wishing.

I look up to people I admire because I'm fascinated by their accomplishments.

I grew up admiring people with good jobs.

I admired people who owned successful business.

I've been a fan for decades.

Here's the problem.

Fan's are often only observing.

When a fan knows enough, they occassionally criticize.

Here's a bigger problem.

Observing and criticizing means knowing.

Unfortunately, knowing doesn't mean doing. 

If you are not doing, you do not benefit from knowing.

You only see the benefits that successful people receive.

If you really want to know you should do.

Stop wishing for success or skills.

Go learn.

Go practice.

Go spend time.
