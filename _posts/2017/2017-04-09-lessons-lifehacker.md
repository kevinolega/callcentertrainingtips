Lifehacker is one of the blogs that permanently changed my life.

I found it when I was looking for tips on how to organize my desk.

I read it for tools and tips on how to save time and how to be an all-around awesome person.

Fiver of the most awesome people I have met in my life are regular Lifehacker readers.

There are a lot of tips that will save you time and money and at the same time allow you to earn more money this year and instead of writing it all I decided to just put the links here.

You go read them yourself and let me know what worked for you.

I've been reading Lifehacker since 2009 and over time, I had read a lot of the job hunting posts.

If you do happen to read all the posts of Lifehacker and become a regular Lifehacker reader, send me a message because I want you in my life. 

Lifehacker will make you a better person. 

I replaced watching the news, gossiping with my coworkers and spending hours on facebook with reading Lifehacker.

The best thing about lifehacker lessons are how you can apply them and achieve the benefit today.

Here are some of my favorites.
