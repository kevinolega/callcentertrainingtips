> Wikipedia says: A call center or call center is a centralized office used for the purpose of receiving and transmitting a large volume of requests by telephone. A call center is operated by a company to administer incoming product support or information inquiries from consumers. Outgoing calls for telemarketing, clientele, product services, and debt collection are also made.

That’s accurate.

The real question is…

## What Is A Call Center For Me?

Different people will have different answers.

Business owners think call centers are places to outsource business-related tasks they'd rather not handle on their own.

Investors think that call centers are business opportunities.

I didn't write this book for them.

## Let's talk about you.

You just retired from your work voluntarily or involuntarily.

You're bored staying at home.

You'd like to earn some cash.

You're a fresh graduate.

You need to earn money.

You want to help your parents, who sacrificed everything to give you an education.

You want money for yourself.

You also want to save a little money to eventually start a business.

You graduated from your course, and you couldn't find a job.

You're browsing the job listings and can't believe how low the pay is for people who graduate from your course.

You feel that taking jobs that pay below minimum wage is a horrible way to invest your time.

You figured that it's better to switch jobs than to continue the path you studied.

You concluded that investing more resources in a poor decision won't magically transform your results.

You're a single mom looking for a way to make ends meet.

Your office job is just enough to pay for the bills but not enough to raise kids on.

You have a family member who didn't do too well in school.

That family member needs a job.

You decide to push that family member to work in a call center.

You're ambitious.

You want to learn the business practices of successful companies.

You'd like to learn how foreign companies operate.

Call center work is not the perfect solution.

The pay in call center companies is awesome compared to many local job offers.

You may or may not like call center work, depending on your lifestyle.

I present call center work as a stepping stone for the opportunities that you are preparing for.

The first reason why I wanted to work in a call center is I wanted to save money to eventually pay for my tuition fee.

I eventually wanted to use call center money to fund my own business.

Other people use the money to pay for expenses while they figure things out.

Other people may want to use call center income to fund going abroad.

I've seen many people succeed in doing this. 

₱20,000 a month is ₱1,300,000 after five years.

₱25,000 a month is ₱1,625,000 after five years.

₱30,000 a month is ₱1,950,000 after five years.

How did I compute this?

Monthly income x 13 months x 5 years.

Using resourcefulness and imagination can help you fund your goal, whatever your goal is.

What is a call center for you?
