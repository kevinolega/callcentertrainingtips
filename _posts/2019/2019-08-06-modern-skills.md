The world is changing.

And everything is becoming more and more difficult.

Many jobs are paying lower and lower.

But new opportunities are always opening up.

If you only have one skill and it's not very valuable, you won't be able to survive the modern job market.

Here are some examples of skills that I found valuable.

## Some Background

I am self taught.

I didn't get to complete college.

I learned from books and informal training sessions.

I experimented and practiced many different skills.

And combined the skills to build my dream life.

You can too.

If you are committed to changing your life.

It's not that easy.

I made a lot of sacrifices to get to where I am today.

The bigger the sacrifice, the bigger the reward.

The world is now connected. 

And Filipinos are compatible with a lot of English speaking nations. 

We can work with them and earn in their currency.

But you can only unlock this opportunity if you speak the language.

Good English will allow others to trust you.

It says you are dependable.

It says you are like them.

Speaking, reading, writing, listening and thinking in English are key skills.

## Computer skills

You may have a smartphone and just use that as a camera and use Facebook and watch YouTube videos.

But if you don't know how to use a computer, you're almost seen as an illeterate.

## Sales Skills

Sales is simply understanding the intentions of the customers and offering a good solution.

If you have sales skills, you can get people to give you support and in a lot of cases, money.

Unlocking sales skills combined with English skills can give you a giant income boost.
