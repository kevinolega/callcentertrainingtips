This is a sample customer service call.

I'm sharing this to give you an idea of what happens every day.

People complaining about their bill, service or whatever.

This call isn't perfect.

But this gives you an idea of what this is like.

The first example is a bad call which is two minutes.

The second example is the good call which was also two minutes.

The average length of a call varies from company to company.

So if the AHT of an account is nine minutes and you work eight hours a day, expect to repeat this process about 50-60 times a day.

If the AHT of the account is four minutes, expect to receive 120-150 calls a day.

Enjoy the video.
