PisoPinoy is a call center career advice similar to mine but has a different flavor.

The author is from Davao and Cebu.

There's a lot of advice on how to get hired because at one point she was doing recruitment and using the blog as a resource to help people getting hired.

And in case you don't know this yet.

Reputable call center companies offer referral bonus. 

If you refer friends who work for your company, they will give you a nice fat bonus if they pass training and usually more money if they get regularized.

Some companies are not very good at tracking referrals so you need to keep following up.

But the extra bonus is usually worth it.

The author is also incredibly smart and put together advice on how to earn extra money as a call center agent.

The site also has location specific advice that you can take advantage of if you're in the Cebu and Davao region.
