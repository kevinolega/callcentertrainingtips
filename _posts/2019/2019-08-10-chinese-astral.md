What is your Chinese Astral or Chinese Zodiac Sign?

If you don't know, you can do a Google search.

Just go to Google.com and ask the question... 

What is my Chinese zodiac sign?

Most sites will generate your results with your birthday.

I'm a Wood Ox.

What about you?

Write the answer on your journal.

## Note before we begin

I am not superstitious. 

I don't cling strongly to tradition or what other people say.

I prefer to discover things on my own.

That said, I don't believe that Astrology controls my destiny.

I just had fun reading it because it was available to me when I was younger.

Most of the advice that we get from Astrology is just good advice that another person assembled into a format that you can digest on a daily basis.

Wherever you fall into the astrological map, the advice is always to:

1. Actually apply universal good advice that you received from people who have wisdom, experience and knowledge. And make the good advice part of your life. Like keeping your life organized, accumulate money, pray and appreciate your blessings.
2. Don't do anything stupid, rash, emotionally driven or hasty. Especially, if you already know for a fact that your actions will have a negative consequence.
3. Give yourself time to process your decisions and have a solid written plan before committing resources to what you're trying to do.
4. If your problem is fear, go familiarize your self with what you're afraid of and then go confront what you fear.
5. If your problem is a weakness, go confront your weakness.

That's the summary Astrological advice.

The writer just rewrite this advice in a way that we're all excited to read this everyday.

As for Astrological personality types.

I think we all have the the positive traits and negative traits of all the Zodiac signs.

We are all human after all.

We are made from the same remarkable material.

Some of us have different life experience.

And as a result, we relate to some positive traits and negative traits.

If reading astrology is against your religion, the purpose of this activity is to simply discover words used to describe the people of a specific astral sign and give examples of positive and negative traits that you can borrow for your interview answers.

With that in mind, let's begin!
