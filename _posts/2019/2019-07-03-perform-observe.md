When I was new at work.

During my first training session.

The trainer drew an image of a rock band.

The band was singing and playing instruments.

Then he began to draw a crowd of audience with lots of people.

He told us that in the photo there are two kinds of people in the picture.

The musicians and the crowd.

He then asked us.

Who gets paid?

The band! 

We answered.

He then asked us.

Who is paying?

The people!

We answered.

What's the difference?

They're musicians! 

I answered.

He then asked more questions.

How much do these guys get paid?

He asked a bunch of more questions that I couldn't really recall.

But I remember clearly what the lesson from the session was.

When it was time to get serious, he asked the question:

What is the band doing?

**The band is performing.**

**And the crowd is observing.**

He said this is an image of what it's like at work.

The people who are performing get paid really well.

And the people who are not performing don't get paid.

The performers gets rewarded to play.

The observer pays to play.

In the end, you will have to decide what kind of person you are.

Are you going to be a performer or just an observer?

### UPDATE:

Got a good response from facebook:

**Person:**

I'll become a wise observer at first. Observing every aspect to be a good performer. And who knows, Someday I'll play with the guitar too.

**Me:**

Problem with observer mode, the longer you stay an observer, the more difficult it gets to quit becoming an observer and becoming a performer.

There's a lot of consequences.

I've been kicked out of the house.

I've been kicked out of the job.

I've been kicked out of a relationship.

I'm the smartest person with ZERO results.

So it's not really very smart.

Performers have practice, failures and experience.

Failure is good if you're doing something.

Failure as a result of not doing something is the most painful kind of failure I experienced.
