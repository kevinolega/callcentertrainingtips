Communication skills is a universal skill. 

How successful you get with your professional life (salary) and your personal life (relationships) are dependent on how good your communication skills are. 

Poor communicators are always given low paying jobs.

This is also true in personal settings.

Many males can't get a girlfriend because of poor communication skills.

In some situations, they can but are only able to get a lower status partner.

People who communicate poorly, tend to become poor or frustrated in life.

Unless maybe you're a professional fighter like Manny Pacquiao. 

But he's working on improving his communication skills too.

Just compare his old interviews with his current interviews.

Good communication is a skill that allows you to multiply your ability and RESULTS because other people as a consequence of your good communication skills, voluntarily give you support.
