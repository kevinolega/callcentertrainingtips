I grew up hearing the words.

Erap para sa mahirap.

I also heard.

Kung Walang Corrupt, Walang Mahirap.

Many political candidates built their careers by telling people that they are helping the poor.

In 2013, I was new at West Contact Services.

I was struggling with depression and my closest friend at the time recommended that I get a job so I can get structure and direction back in my life.

I'm excited because the company offered me 28k/month and a bunch of other benefits.

So if I kept saving my money.

And only spent 15k/month.

I get to save 10k a month.

And I'd build to a large amount of money in a few years.

I'm excited.

Because I just ran out of money.

I think I have a mental disorder.

I can't cry.

I stopped crying in high school.

Even if I wanted to cry.

Tears do not fall from my eyes.

Money does fall from my eyes.

A week into training, I get a call from my other friend.

Her dad is in the hospital.

I wanted to ignore the message.

But my conscience tells me to go.

She helped me a few months ago.

When I wanted to destroy myself.

So I went there.

I only have 1,600 left.

I gave her 1,400.

Kept the 200.

So I can pay for my transportation.

Buy cigarettes.

And ate siomai and rice.

She was just crying because they ran out of money.

The 1,400 I gave her, allowed them to pay for another dialysis treatment for her dad.

It extended his life for two more days.

I hated myself more for not having enough money.

I need a lot of money to make sure this doesn't happen.

Disaster hits life on a regular basis.

Even if you are good at surviving with little money.

People you care about will need money.

Usually in the form of hospital bills.

Sometimes in the form of bail.

Credit card debt.

But that's the thing.

I threw my money out because of emotions.

I was sad.

So I ate at restaurants multiple times a week.

I was talking to people so I'm distracted.

I buy things at the mall to feel better.

Some are upgrades.

Some are totally useless.

And money disappears if you don't manage it well.

Everybody was buying something stupid back then.

I don't even remember what it is.

You need to be more responsible.

Because disaster will hit you.

And the people important to you.

At the worst possible moment.

When you are not ready.

It will fuck you in the ass.

So you need to be ready.

All the time.

Stop watching TV.

Stop hanging out with loser friends.

Start doing something to improve your life.
