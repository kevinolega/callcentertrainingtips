My efforts on writing lessons on my website is my primary form of community service.

The same efforts are also placed in making my videos.

100% of my advice is based on personal experience.

I'm not just copying answers from the internet.

The lessons I am sharing are the exact ones that have given me personal success.

The other reason is...

I RESPECT YOU.

I'm not trying to impress you or anything.

My lessons and my coaching involves just me asking you questions and sharing my experience in real life.

I want to give the same feel in my videos.

I respect your intelligence.

I'm not trying to entertain you like the other YouTubers who are imitating Eat Bulaga or some other stupid local show.

The intention is to pass on some skills and lesson.

Not just temporary entertainment.

Because I know that you will use my lessons to make your life better.

Every month, I get 3-5 people who message me that they're already earning call center income.

I'm grateful.

Every month, I helped 3-5 people qualify for the opportunity that will allow them to earn almost a couple of million pesos in a few years.

I'm not trying to be funny.

I'm not trying to win any debates.

I'm just providing value.

I've been sharing lessons on how to get hired since 2005.

And I'm likely going to do this for a long time.

Without the support of any company or the government.

That being said, I'm only sharing lessons.

And besides...

If you've ever watched the other call center tips on YouTube with the stupid music that makes the lessons difficult to listen to.

And the laughter that insults your intelligence.

If you pay attention long enough, you'll realize that these losers have zero value to share.

But that's just my opinion.

You're free to watch anyone.
