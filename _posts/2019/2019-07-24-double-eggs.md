Here's how to double your extra money while working in a call center.

## Step 1: Buy dozen eggs. 

Go to the grocery and buy a dozen eggs.

## Step 2: Look for a recipe on how to boil the egg. 

My favorite chefs are Gordon Ramsay, Heston Blumenthal and Jamie Oliver.

## Step 3: Boil the eggs. 

Follow the instructions from the website or the video on how to boil the egg.

## Step 4: Sell the egg for ₱15 each.

That's it. 

At the time I did this supermarket eggs cost 6 pesos. 

I sold each egg for ₱15.

My profit for each egg sold is ₱9.

## Step 5: Add salt to your baon. 

Salt is cheap. I like Himalayan Pink Salt.

## Here are computations from the time I did this in a call center:

Initial investment: ₱72

Ending balance: ₱180

Profit from selling 1 dozen eggs: 9 x 12 = ₱108

Profit from selling 2 dozen eggs: 9 x 24 = ₱216

Profit if you sell one dozen for 20 days: ₱2,160

Profit if you sell two dozen for 20 days: ₱4,340

One year of selling one dozen eggs: ₱25,920

One year of selling two dozen eggs: ₱51,840

Do this for two years you can buy your dream gadgets.

At the time of this writing, my goals were to buy an iPhone 7 plus, iPad Pro or Macbook.

## Other Costs to selling eggs

15 minutes prep and cook time. You'll also pack the eggs.

## How to Overcome Objections and Obstacles:

You can only sell 2 dozen eggs maximum sa call center kung magaling ka mag tago sa guard.

Pag nahuli ka sabihin mo nag-gym ka and kailangan mo ng protein every 2 hours kaya madami kang egg. 

Baon mo yan.

If your coworker asks bakit ang mahal. 

Ten pesos nalang.

Tell your coworker to buy at 711 or somewhere else. 

Eggs costs ₱15 to ₱20 depending on where you buy.

If nobody buys. 

Go eat the eggs. 

Eggs are good for you.

I eat ten eggs a day so I only sold half of what I bring.

I usually end up eating eight to ten a day.

Eating eggs saves me money.

Junk food and processed food from canned goods and fast food is a big cause of health issues for many call center agents.
