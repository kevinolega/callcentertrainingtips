The right thing to do is to find the mistake and fix it.

The stupid thing to do is to give up on your goals.

You don't stop eating for the rest of your life because you failed to learn how to cook an egg a few times.

You figure out what you are doing wrong and stop doing that.

You learn what works and repeat that.

You learn what doesn't work and stop doing that.
