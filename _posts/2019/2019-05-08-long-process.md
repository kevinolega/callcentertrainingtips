Many call center companies follow a one-day process.

You can know the same day if you pass or fail.

Knowing the results quickly is a good thing.

You would know when it’s time to move on to the next company.

The best thing to do is to move on to the next company when you fail.

Don’t forget to write the lessons learned from your failure in your notebook.

The written lessons will become what you’ll need to to keep going.

Failure is part of the process.

You need to collect lessons from failure if you want success.

A one-day process can mean anything.

You may start in the morning.

You may end in the afternoon or evening.

You may start in the afternoon.

You’ll finish late at night or the next day already.
The longer the company lets you stay, the better.

Staying means you are moving forward with the process.

Don’t forget to ask your interviewer or proctor for tips on the next step.

I hope you do well.
