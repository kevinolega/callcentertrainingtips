How you spend your resources is how you will spend your future.

If you spend on your health while you are young, you will spend on it less when you are old.

If you spend time learning now, you will earn more when you are old.

If you spend your money on the right things you will receive rewards when you are old.

Do you like your life?

Are you old?

Did you spend your resources and utilized your blessings wisely?

Grow up , buddy.
