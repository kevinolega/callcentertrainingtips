Negative Emotions are God's reminder that it's time to make a change.

Are you dissatisfied with your life?

Maybe what you are doing isn't very good for you.

Are your parents always mad at you?

Maybe you aren't very mature yet or taking responsibility for your life.

Is your potential in-laws saying nasty things about you?

Maybe you haven't reached the level of success that they'll be confident to entrust their baby to you.

Are you still watching too many movies, anime and playing games?

Maybe it's time to grow up.

One day, when you're old.

Some kid will ask you why you're not a loser.

And maybe that kid will ask his/her parent who happens to be a close friend of yours.

Then that close friend.

The expression on his/her face is slightly embarrassed that you're friends.

Kasi medyo nakakahiya ka ngang kaibigan.

Kasi para kang si Peter Pan.

Who never grew up.

It's time to grow up.

It's time to take responsibility for your life.

It's time to accept that everything around you is 100% your fault.

Then start giving yourself a push.

In the right direction.

Truth hurts.

Real talk lang.

Matanda ka na.

I ❤️ you guys!!!
