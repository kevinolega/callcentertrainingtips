Watching English Movies And TV Shows Won't Improve Your English

If you use English TV Shows and movies to try and improve your English.

The only skill you’ll build is your skill of watching the movie or TV series.

Let’s be honest.

We like how the actors/actress look.

We love the story.

We enjoyed the fight scene.

We enjoyed the escape or chase scene.

We loved the ending.

We loved the lessons and discussions from the movie or TV show.

You’ll just become more knowledgeable.

About the Marvel cinematic universe.

About the Fast universe.

About Disney movies.

About whatever movie or show you’re watching.

But movies and TV shows have very little to teach you about the key English skills that will land you a call center job.

## Give introductions.

You'll introduce yourself to the interviewer several times. You'll introduce yourself in training. You'll introduce yourself to the customer all the time when you get hired.

## Ask questions. 

Call center work is 90% asking questions. Your interviewer is judging you how well you use questions to deal with situations you don't know how to handle and questions that you know the answer to.

## Give step by step instructions.

After asking questions, you're required to give the customer the solution in the form of step by step instructions.

## Tell a story.

When you're selling yourself, and you share a positive point, you will be required to tell a story to explain how things worked out. Telling stories are one of the primary convincing tool in sales and getting support from someone.

These are sometimes covered by movies and TV shows.

The keyword that you need to pay attention to is: sometimes.

That means not all the time.

I mean, sure you can sometimes find a small piece of pizza in a garbage dump but that’s not the best way to get pizza.

The best way is to write your ideas and discuss with a person who speaks English well.

Some guy suggested Anime.

Here's my answer.

Tiny elements are available in Anime. It covers the introductions part in the first three episodes. Then it's just story-based dialogue.

There's very little professional conversation covered in movies and TV shows unless you're watching an "Office/Business based" movie and TV show.

And it doesn't help accelerate the growth of the skill of people who have bad English and turn them to people with good English.

It gives people an idea of what natural-sounding English is but it doesn't provide a very good practical application.

Anime covers a lot of introductions.

But it doesn't cover asking intelligent questions, rapport-building questions, sales related questions, and questions related to interviews.

Step by step instructions aren't covered as much. Perhaps you'll find it in sports anime or heist movies, but not all movies have this element but there's no guarantee that you'll absorb the complete skill.

Cooking shows cover the step by step instructions element better than most movies.

Using stories to illustrate the point without directly saying what your trying to say is a very useful interview skill. Not something you learn in movies.

What usually stays with us is the drama/action of the story. Usually the emotional context of the film.

Not so much of what needs to be covered for getting a job and overcoming difficult interviews.

Talking to people who are better at speaking in English have better results because of the kinesthetic element.

In other words, you get actual practice instead of doing everything in your head.

The other advantage is that the other person will be able to spot and correct your mistakes.

The second most useful is journaling, reading the words out loud, recording a video and listening for incorrect pronunciation and grammar.

That's the reason why I compare watching movies and shows to finding pizza in the garbage dump.

Compared to the top two methods, you'll get far inferior results in the context of job application.

The other guy who recommended anime got me thinking.

You'll want to watch the first few episodes of whatever for character introductions.

Then you'll shift to sports anime and cooking anime for step by step instructions.

You'll also want to shift to a business/work/slice of life anime for conversational story-telling elements.

Japanese are also indirect with their manner of speaking so they're not very compatible with American culture, unfortunately.

You'll also need higher intelligence to pull this off. 

That will also be dozens of hours of anime. 

And after a certain point the focus turns to the entertainment instead of the educational element of the show.

At which point the whole thing becomes a distraction instead of a productive practice session.

Like I said, there's nothing wrong with entertainment. It's just that some people are stuck just watching movies and not getting better.

Earlier today, I was assisting a security guard improve his English.

He said all he does is watch English shows and practice in front of a mirror.

But he's applied over a dozen times and the advice has always been to watch English movies.

But he doens't know exactly what to change and how to fix his English using what he learned from watching the movie.
