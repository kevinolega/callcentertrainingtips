If you use English TV Shows and movies to try and improve your English.

The only skill you'll build is your skill of watching the movie or TV series.

Let's be honest.

We like how the actors/actress look.

We love the story.

We enjoyed the fight scene.

We enjoyed the escape or chase scene.

We loved the ending.

We loved the lessons and discussions from the movie or TV show.

You'll just become more knowledgeable.

About the Marvel cinematic universe.

About the Fast universe.

About Disney movies.

About whatever movie or show you're watching.

But movies and TV shows have very little to teach you about the key English skills that will land you a call center job.

Give introductions.

Ask questions.

Give step by step instructions.

Tell a story.

These are sometimes covered by movies and TV shows.

Keyword that you need to pay attention to is: sometimes.

That means not all the time.

I mean, sure you can sometimes find a small piece of pizza in a garbage dump but that's not the best way to get pizza.

The best way is to write your ideas and discuss with a person who speaks English well.
