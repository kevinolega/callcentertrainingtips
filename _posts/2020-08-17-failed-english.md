I failed college English.

As a consequence, I had to stop going to school.

There.

I said it.

This happened in 2003.

I had to leave college in 2004.

But that's old news.

It's 2020 and I did other things with my life.

Why are we going back to this part?

That's because every disaster comes with a powerup.

We are going back in time to collect the power up.

In case this is your first time reading about me.

Kevin Olega has a reputation for having poor communication skills from childhood to college.

When Kevin turned eighteen, his poor communication skills got him kicked out of school so he had to fend for himself and start working.

Kevin worked in the mall as a salesperson, eventually worked in real estate sales and worked as a financial products salesperson.

Kevin worked for a call center school, a Korean English academy, and did one to one tutorials for extra income.

Kevin later worked in corporate sales and the BPO industry.

In 2008, Kevin spent his free time learning how to write.

In 2016, Kevin began working as a professional writer, he also accepted a job to work as a Virtual Assistant and eventually got promoted to Project Manager.

Kevin had a reputation of having poor communication skills but spend most of his career working jobs where higher level communication skills is the primary requirement.

How did he do this?

That's for another story.

Now Kevin failed college English.

Here's how.

I'm fairly good at grammar rules.

I can string compound-complex sentences without a lot of effort.

I have an extensive vocabulary.

I love reading.

I also consumed 95-98% English media growing up.

The books, comicbooks, magazines, games, TV shows and movies that I read are English.

I have friends and family who speak in English all the time.

I talk to them whenever possible.

So what's the problem?

In the previous college English subject, the instructor discussed the lessons, we had quizes, and we had exams.

In the next English subject, we were graded based on completing projects.

We were given almost complete freedom to work on our projects.

We had all the free time that we need to research, compose and interview sources.

Our school has a vast library and unlimited high speed internet access.

That's my first time to have access to those resources.

I picked a topic close to my heart.

I picked martial arts.

The instructor approved my topic.

What's the problem?

The scope of my topic was too big.

I spent too much time reading online.

I tried to write something that sounded long and intelligent.

I gathered a lot of info but failed to compose something that can easily be understood.

I wasn't writing things down.

I was depending on my memory for everything.

I end up spending half the day trying to decide on what to do next.

I'm so exhausted I finish none of my tasks that day.

My mind was slowly breaking down.

I was being overwhelmed.

On top of that, I was researching unrelated topics.

So I spent the entire trimester distracted and eventually panicking.

When the deadline arrived my work was unfinished.

I probably wrote 15% of the entire thing.

It was garbage.

It was difficult to understand.

My instructor had no choice but to fail me.

In order for me to succeed in the future I went back to this memory to find what I did wrong.

I started writing notes.

I started focusing on smaller projects.

No big projects for me.

I log out of Facebook more often.

I say no to a lot of distractions.

[I even have a rejection page to quickly declinine invitations](https://kevinolega.com/n).

Every now and then, I have to take a big project out of necessity.

I break it down most projectis into tiny parts.

The younger me, loved the things I loved with a passion.

The younger me spent a lot of time studying martial arts, video games, books and movies.

The younger me also spent a lot of time with friends.

I got to focus when I ignore entertainment and people.

It seems to me like bordom increases creativity.

I'd like to schedule my entertainment to once a week instead of daily.

It's hard.

But it's the only way for me to do what I need to do.

I'm 34 now.

There are people who can stay away from entertainment effortlessly.

I'm the kind of person that doesn't stop until I finish a show. 

I'm still trying to work on that. 

I'll stop writing here.

I'll get back to this memory to try and farm it for lessons.

Do you have a similar experience?
