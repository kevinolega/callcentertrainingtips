I failed college English.

There.

I said it.

This happened in 2003.

I had to leave college in 2004.

But that's old news.

It's 2020 and I did other things with my life.

Why are we going back to this part?

That's because every disaster comes with a powerup.

We are going back in time to collect the power up.

In case this is your first time reading about me.

Kevin Olega has a reputation for having poor communication skills from childhood to college.

When Kevin turned eighteen, his poor communication skills got him kicked out of school so he had to fend for himself and start working.

Kevin worked in the mall as a salesperson, eventually worked in real estate sales and took a few financial planning classes.

Kevin worked for a call center school, a Korean English academy, and did one to one tutorials for extra income.

Kevin later worked in corporate sales and the BPO industry.

In 2008, Kevin spent his free time learning how to write.

In 2016, Kevin began working as a professional writer, he also accepted a job to work as a Virtual Assistant and eventually got promoted to Project Manager.

Kevin had a reputation of having poor communication skills but spend most of his career working jobs where higher level communication skills is the primary requirement.

How did he do this?

That's for another story.

Now Kevin failed college English.

Here's how.

I'm fairly good at grammar rules.

I can string compound-complex sentences without a lot of effort.

I have an extensive vocabulary.
