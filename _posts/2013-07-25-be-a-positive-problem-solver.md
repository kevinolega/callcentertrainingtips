If you think about it carefully, people who succeed at their goals have a positive mindset.

You don't have to blindly pretend that everything is fine but you need to acknowledge the fact that there is a solution to your problem.

Ask yourself:

What is the problem?

What is the solution that you can think of?

What is the best solution?

Test it. See what happens.

Did it work?

If yes. Improve it further. If no try something else.

Another key is don't get too attached to the results.

If the results are not favorable, look for lessons and corrections.

Do not take anything personally. The goal is to get the results that you want and/or improvement not credit or self validation.

Fear points you in the direction that you need to go. Failure points you in the direction of what you need to work on and improve.

If you've actively tried to learn any skill, I feel you will agree that the same rules apply.

To sum it up:

1.  Be positive.
2.  Look for solutions.
3.  Start small. Then increase as you move forward.
4.  Keep going.
5.  Improve gradually
6.  Look for ways to do it better.
7.  Celebrate
8.  Repeat
