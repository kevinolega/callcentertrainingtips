Use simple words when communicating in a business setting like sales and customer service.

The goal of business communication is to effectively convey the message to the other person.

Using complicated words often requires further explanation and usually back-and-forth that results in wasted time for everybody involved.

This is the opposite advice of what we learned in school.

Our grade-school and high school teachers are happy when we used complicated vocabulary words.

The main goal of high school teachers is to prepare you for college where you'll be using academic English.

Big words and complicated sentences will sound impressive in specific situations.

You are not speaking to college professors and advanced scholars in a business transaction.

The goal of business communication is to make the transaction convenient for customers. 

Complicated vocabulary makes the process inconvenient.

Requiring clients to check an online dictionary every few words is just plain inconsiderate.

Instead, you'd want to do the opposite and use simple words.

You'll learn several new words when you're working in business and jobs like sales, customer service and technical support.

Many of the words that you'll learn on the job are called "jargon" or insider language.

Insider language means you can use these words to discuss with your coworkers and employers but you don't use these words to discuss with customers.

However, you'll use simpler words when speaking to clients and customers to minimize the need for unneccessary explanations.

For example, a doctor will use heart attack instead of myocardial infarction to explain to the patient and family members.

In the same way, you'd want to practice using simpler words in your conversations.

Complicated words sound impressive but simple words get results.
