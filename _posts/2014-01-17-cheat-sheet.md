I'm going to share you one of my biggest secrets why I can get to improve people's skills faster. 

Ready? 

Here goes. 

I teach them how to focus on... 

wait for it... 

few! 

I teach them to focus on a few things that are important.

Back in school I'm notorious for asking the teacher why a boring lesson is important to learn and I still do. 

I don't do it out loud but sometime extra lessons are not really useful.

If something is not worth learning then it is important to not learn the lesson. 

That's just how I think personally.

If you need to improve your English skills you don't need to go through every word in the dictionary. 

You only need a few. 

Where then do we start? 

How about the top 100 most used words in the English language? 

It is the most used after all, so it makes sense that we get this right now. 

Do you agree?

I didn't invent this but I found this very useful. Here's the list. I copied it from Wikipedia. Why? Because it works. Here's how you use it.

Can I pronounce each word correctly? Can I say it right?

Do I know what each word means? Can I come up with a short definition?

Can I use each word in a sentence?

**Here's an exercise:**


1. Write each word on a piece of paper. Add enough space to write two short sentences.
2. Read the words out loud. In your own words, define the word. For fun translate into Filipino. Use the word in a sentence.
3. Record what you wrote on your phone. Listen to it and ask your self if it sounds right.
