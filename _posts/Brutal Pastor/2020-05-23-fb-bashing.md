I always advise my students against bashing people on social media.

There are several "secret groups" and forums where they discuss difficult work conditions.

These days it's incredibly tempting to do some form of bashing or cyberbullying everybody does it.

The thing with groups like these is it attracts all sorts of people.

I find many intelligent posts and responses in the comment section that I speculate that about 1% of the members of this group will advance to the top of their careers.

So when you attempt to bash someone, remember that the person reading your negative post or comment in 2020 may still be an agent or a new supervisor who may eventually become your (or your children's) future boss or employer.

And they will likely remember your name and face.
