The world won't adjust to you.

The world won't give you your dreams.

You have to earn it.

You have to work for it.

You have to fight for it.

Who do you fight?

You have to fight the loser version of yourself.

You have to fight your stupidity.

You have to fight your negativity.

The reason why you don't get what you want is you are stupid and a loser who hasn't grown up yet.

What is missing from you?

Do you lack education?

Do you lack good friends?

Do you lack maturity?

You can get these things for less than a thousand pesos a month.

You can buy a book.

You can buy a smart friend Starbucks every payday to get advice.

You can change your life.

You're just too scared to make a move.

Many people settle for being stupid.
