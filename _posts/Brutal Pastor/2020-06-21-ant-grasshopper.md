When I was younger, I listened to the story of the ant and the grasshopper.

I keep reminding myself of the story because it moves me out of my laziness.

Here's the short version in six sentences.

The story begins in the summer.

An ant worked building shelter and gathered food daily.

The grasshopper did nothing but play around.

The story ends in the winter.

The ant survived because he had food and shelter.

The grasshopper had no food nor shelter.

It was snowing.

## Lesson

People behave either like the ant or the grasshopper in real life.

What behavior will you choose?
