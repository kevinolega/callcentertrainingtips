Please don't blindly trust us.

We only provide lessons and instructions.

Many of our lessons are posted on our website and Facebook page.

You want to get used to doing some research too.

Research is a small but important call center skill.

Whenever people enroll... 

We send the students lessons and activities.

We wait for the student to finish the writing activities and schedule the phone coaching session.

We read the student's answers, whether it's scanned or encoded.

We discuss some techniques and listen to the student's English over the phone.

We point out errors and recommend corrections.

We make them read a list of common words, and we fix their pronunciations.

Whenever the student gets hired, promoted, or improve their English for personal reasons, it's all the student.

Our student paid us a small amount, just enough to buy a few hamburgers and we spent time with them in return.

It's the student who wrote dozens of pages a day for several weeks.

It's the student who frowned at the news that they had to repeat the activity but did it anyway.

It's the student who wrote a long version and a short version of their career and personal stories.

It's the student who committed his goals on paper and wrote down a detailed plan on how to succeed.

It's the student who quit playing games, socializing, and entertainment to spend more time researching on Google, reading, and writing.

The effort is 100% provided by our students.

That said, 100% of the credit should belong to the student.

That's what I learned from all my teachers, and that's the lesson that I wish to impart.

I'm not the hero of your story.

You are the hero of your story.

I just taught you a few moves and techniques because I don't want you to look up to me.

I want you to look up to yourself.

Stay committed, focused, and disciplined.

We'll be here to assist you.
