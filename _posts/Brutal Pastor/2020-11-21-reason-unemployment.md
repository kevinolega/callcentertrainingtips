74% of people won't act because they're afraid of judgement.

They already enrolled. 

They bought a notebook.

They sit down.

They don't do anything.

They browse the internet.

They'll scroll Facebook.

Someone asks them what they're doing.

They say, "nothing."

They say they'll "play a short game."

They're on the phone until the battery runs out.

How many sentences did they write?

Some people wrote zero.

Some people wrote one or two.

Seven out of ten students don't submit anything.

Weeks pass, I'm emailing them to follow up.

Some students tell me they're busy.

Some students don't reply at all.

During enrollment, the student told us their objective.

Today the student has a convincing reason to quit.

I'm thinking.

You put in a lot of effort into composing that excuse why you're quitting.

You put in time and brain power to assemble that message in your head.

If you only used your brain power to write the sentences that I asked you to write, next year, you'll be thanking me for that ₱150,000 in your bank.

I'm not sad because you spent money and you did nothing.

I'm horrified that you're so arrogant.

I'm sick at the thought your family will be facing 2021 and all future years lacking your ₱150,000 contribution.

I've been working since I was 18 years old.

My parents stopped paying for my education.

I had to fend for myself.

Ever since, I looked down on people who proudly declare they're PAL or palamunin sa bahay.

I still do.

I'm older now.

I know the consequences.

I know how being unemployed makes the the rest of the family miserable.

I've visited so many hospitals.

I've attended so many funerals.

I've seen middle-class families literally go to hell because of poverty.

I've seen people lose homes.

I've seen family members die because they didn't have money to buy medicine.

I know how being unemployed leaves you vulnerable to depression.

I know how being unemployed kills your confidence.

I know how being unemployed will make you fat, sad, and eventually want to kill yourself.

Unemployment is a literal portal to hell.

Do something man.

For fuck's sake!

You paid me.

Stop being lazy.

Go write that sentence!
