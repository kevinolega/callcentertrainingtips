> Call center companies hire applicants with low educational attainment but reject you for having bad English. Even college graduates do not have perfect English. This is discrimination. - Anonymous Reader

I'm going to say something really offensive.

International call center companies are supposed to reject you if you have bad English.

Call center agents are front-liners who perform customer service, tech support, and sales work.

You will be working for American companies and serving American customers.

You assist foreign customers over the phone while you document the situation on your computer.

You need to qualify for international standards.

Excellent English communication skills are a minimum requirement.

You need to become comfortable using computers for internet research.

Your IQ needs to be high enough to solve simple problems by asking intelligent questions.

You must be mature enough to be customer service oriented and professional.

If you want to succeed, you need to abandon this “entitled” attitude.

Practice and make yourself a better person to hire.

Aim to become a better person.

That’s the only way you’ll genuinely become proud of yourself.
