Life is 100%.

90% is...

10% is...

Losers and winners have different perspectives.

Losers believe that life is 90% what happens and 10% how they respond to it.

Other people call this "Victim mentality."

Winners believe that life is 10% what happens and 90% how they respond to it.

Other people call this "taking full responsibility."

After reading this you're likely going to say that you see life as successful people do.

It's extremely hard to say that you are 100% responsible for all your misfortunes and disasters.

Only time will tell.
