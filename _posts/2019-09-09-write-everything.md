Get a larger piece of paper like a long bond paper or a sketchpad.

If you don't have a piece of paper, you can use two pages of your notebook.

Then write down everything that you know.

On the right side, write down your business related or serious skills.

Everything you learned at work, earning a living or life.

On the left side, write down all your fun skills.

I try to include every topic that I'm knowledgeable about.
