Don't just survive. Prepare.

If you are not prepared, you are GAMBLING.

And we all know that gamblers lose big time.

Life is always happening for you, not to you.

All your failures.

All your heartbreaks.

All those mistakes.

All those sad stories.

All those misfortunes.

All that is God's greatest gift.

To turn you into the person that you are meant to be.

Your job is to investigate these sad stories and find the benefit.

If you do.

If you build up the courage.

Your life will be better.

Everything you want in life is guarded by everything you fear in life.

So when you are afraid, it's a sign from God that the blessing is near.

When you voluntarily confront what you fear, then you will succeed.

But if you will run away from your fear, it will catch up to you and eat you, and destroy everything that you care about.

True story.
