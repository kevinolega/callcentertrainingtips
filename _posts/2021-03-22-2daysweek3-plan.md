I got this question from a student.

I have a job.

I have a full day at work and responsibilities at home.

I'm only available to train during my rest days.

I have two rest days.

Can I still take your lessons?

## MY ANSWER:

Yes you can.

Here is my proposed schedule if you can only practice during your rest day.

I imagine that you can only spend 2-3 hours a day pracicing.

Here's my proposed schedule for our six-week module.

If you're only available during weekends, you may finish three activities a day.

It may take you an 2-3 hours working on the exercises.

You're free to do more if you're capable of doing so.

You'll finish in ten weeks if you follow this plan.

Here's what your schedule will look like.
