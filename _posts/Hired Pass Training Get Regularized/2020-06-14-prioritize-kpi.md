When you get hired in a call center, you will become familiar with the term KPI.

KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator.

KPI's are a means of tracking if you are doing your job.

Many agents receive warnings and eventually get terminated for failing to meet KPI's.

The best way to meet KPI's is to focus on as few KPI's at the time.

I began working on my KPI's when my team leader warned me that I was about to get fired.

I focused on the top 2.

1. Attendance.
2. Customer service feedback.

Depending on what company you will work for and the most important KPI of your company, your experience may vary.

I recommend being the best at the top 2 KPI's first then slowly work on improving the other KPI's.

Here's what I did:

Attendance is always the most important KPI.

If your attendance is perfect, you can receive more second chances. 

Early on, I understood the priority in our account.

Next to having perfect attendance, the customer service score is the most important.

Getting a good number of sales is the second most important.

Getting a good QA score is the next most important.

AHT is at the bottom.

So I have always sacrificed AHT and QA in favor of PERFECT Customer Service Score and Sales.

How do I know this?

I don't.

I just based this conclusion on which metrics get paid by the company.

Our company pays us an extra $80 for a perfect customer service score for the whole month.

Our company also pays us anywhere from $8-20 for each sale.

I'll work extra hard on tasks that pay extra.

I just follow the money.

Our company does not pay us an attendance bonus.

But I know that our company terminates people for attendance violations.

That is enough to motivate me with the attendance KPI.

I can't win if I can play.

If my attendance is perfect, I can keep playing.

The next step is Customer Service Feedback or customer survey.

I just need to keep the customer happy.

It's easy enough.

I just made sure that my English is good enough, so I don't like a foreigner to our American customers.

I also need to understand the rules of our company.

But that's for another story.
