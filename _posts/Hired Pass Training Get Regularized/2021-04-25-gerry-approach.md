TL Gerry taught me a lot about problem solving.

Here's the tip that stood out.

Gerry got me to focus on the most important tasks at hand.

We only solved one or two problems at a time.

We began fixing the following:

1. Most common call.
2. Easiest issue to master.

We try to fix just one issue at a time.

Let's say that a newbie agent needs to handle 20 different kinds of issues.

If you master 1 issue, that issue won't be a problem for the rest of your career.

You have 19 issues left.

You can fix another issue tomorrow or next week.

When you become an expert, you can push yourself to learn the top 50 issues.

For today, just focus on one big issue.

Alternatively, you can focus on two simple issues.

Ask yourself the following questions:

What's the problem?

What's the solution?

Focus on fixing just one problem at a time.

Learn how to fix one difficult issue at a time.

TL Gerry didn't require a dramatic change from me.

TL Gerry consistently led me to become 1% better everyday.

That's all I needed to do.

He taught me a solution for one issue and encouraged me to take notes and master the process.

It's always a good idea to have a record of your problems.

What's causing your long calls?

What's causing upset customers?

Find solutions for specific issues.

Solve each issue one by one.

Work with your supervisor.

Ask for help.

All problems have a beginning, middle, and end.

What's your problem as an agent?

If the problem is all of the above, start from the beginning.

What's the first thing that I need to do to solve this problem?

Do your best to document and then memorize the beginning.

Slowly work on transitioning to the middle.

Eventually, work on solving the problem.

TL Gerry was extemely patient with me.

For complex topics, he had me memorize the beginning of what to do.

He asked me to call him whenever I had a problem.

Gerry coached me through the middle until we got to the end of the solution.

I eventually got used to solving the problem and we rarely had to solve the same issue together.

He probably assisted me thirty times but I eventually never needed his help on a call.

Eventually, I rarely escalated my issues to a supervisor call.
