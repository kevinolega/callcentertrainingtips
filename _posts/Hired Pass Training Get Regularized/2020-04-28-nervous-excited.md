Whenever I am nervous, I replace the word "nervous" with the word "excited" to describe how I feel.

Let's do an activity.

I want you to go back to your past experience.

Use your memory and imagination to go back to a time when you felt nervous.

Without using words, try to remember how you feel.

You usually feel a little shaky or jittery with some energy building up in your body like you're ready to run away from this thing causing your nervousness.

Now go back to a time when you felt excited.

You feel like jumping up and down with the same energy building up and your body feels like you're going to run toward what you're excited about.

If the words have been taken out of the picture and you only had to rely on what you feel, both these sensations physically feel identical.

The only difference is when you begin to use the word "nervous" you feel clumsy.

When you use the word "excited" you feel purposeful and spontateous.

Whenever you are nervous, try using the word excited to see if you will perform better.

This takes practice so start now.
