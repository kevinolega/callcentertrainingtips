I believe that if you want other people to give you something, you should go first.

When I started in my previous call center company, I'm known as Kevin with...

1. The weird packed lunch.
2. The weird notebook. Always writing everything down like a nerd.
3. The stupid questions that made the training discussions longer.
4. The stupid questions that made the team meetings and discussions longer.
5. The creepy stalker who asks random team leaders who the top performers are and sits next to top performers and listens to their calls and take notes in their weird notebook.
6. The weird person who starts conversations with people he doesn't know and takes notes on his notebook like a fucking reporter.

Even my team leader gave me an autistic nickname.

They call me "Happy Bear."

Then I changed all that.

I became like a superhero or a WWE professional wrestler.

When I report my sales to the team leader, I wait for my team leader to be talking to his boss and shout...

"Happy Bear has a sale."

And it became a thing.

I'm no longer Kevin the weirdo.

I'm "Happy Bear."

Happy Bear always has a sale.

Happy Bear has another 100% customer survey.

Happy Bear can turn every difficult situation into a happy customer.

I kept the happy bear name for three years.

I became top agent in Customer Service Feedback.

I became top agent in sales.

I became super agent.

I beat every Comcast agent on the day that I got robbed on my way to work with perfect attendance, sale, customer feedback, QA and AHT.

I think that's the time that I encountered this quote.

It changed my life so I'm sharing it here...

> "Let me give you some advice, bastard."

Tyrion tells him... 

> “Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you.”

## Activity.

On your notebook, write this question...

What is my main goal?

What can I give first so I can achieve my goal?
