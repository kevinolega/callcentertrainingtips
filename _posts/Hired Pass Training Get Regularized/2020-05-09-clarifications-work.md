Here's what to expect when you get hired in a call center.

When you get hired, you'll go through training.

In some situations, you'll have two sets of training.

1. New Hire Training (English skills review, Customer service etiquette.)
2. Product Specific or Account Specific Training.

In other situations, you'll go straight to Account Specific training.

Training may last from two weeks to a month.

After training, you'll go through OJT.

### During New Hire Training...

You'll review some basic English and fix some of your remaining grammar errors.

You'll be taught basic customer service etiquette.

You'll learn about the rules of the company.

### During Product Specific Training...

You'll be taught about the account you'll be assigned to.

The account is the call center company's client.

You will be servicing the account's customers.

You will be taught the specific service, processes, rules, tools and spiels that you will be executing every day.

Ask as many questions as you can and take notes.

### During OJT...

You'll begin to take calls.

You'll talk to customers.

The trainer and your Team Leader will be watching and guiding you as you work.

Continue asking questions and taking notes at this stage.

If you pass OJT, you'll become a full fledged call center agent.

### Attendance is the most important metric...

During the training stage, it is important to never be late and never be absent for any reason.

High paying opportunities are given to people who are dependable.

If you are not at work on time and ready to go at the start of your shift, you are not dependable.

90% of the people who got eliminated during training and OJT are people with attendance violations.

Make sure that you are getting enough sleep.

Say no to all requests from friends to hang out.

Do not break your sleep pattern.

### Adjusting your Attitude will help you keep your job...

You are talking to customers who are angry.

You are trying to complete complex tasks.

You are running many different instructions at the same time.

You are speaking in English non stop for eight hours a day.

Always ask your team leader on what to do, take notes and thank them for their help.

On your way home, study your notes.

### Avoiding Losers Will Help You Survive...

90% of your training batch won't pass OJT.

Don't get too attached.

Many of these people will act like friends.

That's not true.

They'll just borrow money and resign.

They usually have some emergency and will use emotional black mail, like a kid with no milk or a parent in the hospital.

Don't do it.

You just met these people.

Focus on helping yourself first.

In some cases these agents have picked up a bad attitude or bad practice from a previous company.

They'll say things like...

- They don't really check our attendance, I've been taking two or three hour lunches and nobody notices. No, they're just giving you a chance to get your act together. These people got fired.
- Press this combination of numbers on the phone so you can get rid of nasty customers and keep your AHT score down. Nope, you'll get fired.
- In our old call center, we follow a different set of rules...

LISTEN TO SUCCESS

MANAGE YOUR MONEY WELL

MANAGE YOUR ENERGY

INVEST THE DIFFERENCE.

DON'T SPEND IT ALL IN ONE PLACE.

YOU HAVE A FUTURE.
