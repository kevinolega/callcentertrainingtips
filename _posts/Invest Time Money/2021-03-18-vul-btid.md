I GOT THIS QUESTION:

I want to i know your opinion on VUL and BTID. If you have time maybe you can share your thoughts about this one. ☺️

MY ANSWER:

I unfortunately purchased VUL. 

I feel that BTID might be a better strategy but only if you know what you're doing.

I know how to cook. 

When I eat out, I never order steaks, salads, and pasta.

These meals are extremely expensive at restaurants.

I enjoy these meals at home.

However, I understand the kind of work needed to make ramen.

So I end up paying ₱500 for a bowl even if I can recognise that the meal contains ₱80 worth of ingredients. 

That said buying term may be more economical if you know what you are doing. 

VUL has more fees for a reason.

It also depends on what you mean by VUL. Is the fund using a Mutual Fund or and Index funds.

I just decided to keep my current VUL and paying my obligations with zero intention to upgrade.

I get value from my FA servicing me and assisting in my transactions so I don't mind paying the hefty fee. 

I'm topping up the index funds instead moving forward.
