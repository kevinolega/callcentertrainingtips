I RECEIVED THIS QUESTION:

I'm broke. I have â‚±1,000 pesos left.

Should I buy your training promo, to get hired in a call center?

HERE'S MY ANSWER:

No.

Please read our lessons.

Please watch our videos.

Please do the recommended writing activities.

Focus on surviving.

Get a job.

Get whatever job that you'll qualify for.

Save money.

Put your life together.

Use your rest-day to look for work.

It's difficult to get a job when you are hungry and desperate for money.

It is easy to upgrade your income when you're employed.

You'll have better career plans if you are relaxed, well-fed, and well-rested.
