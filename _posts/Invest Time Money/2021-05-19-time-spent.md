One day is 24 hours

You sleep eight hours.

You're at work nine hours.

You're commuting two hours.

You'll spend another hour eating.

You'll spend another two hours on chores.

You have two hours that you can use for anything you want.

What are you going to do with your final two hours?

Are you going to watch TV, play a game, or study?

Your future is 100% up to you.

Your life is the result of all your decisions in the past five years.

What did you decide to do five years ago that led you here?

What will you decide to do today that will lead to brighter future?

It's never too late if you decide to start today.
