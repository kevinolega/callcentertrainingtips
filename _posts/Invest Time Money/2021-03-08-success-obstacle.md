I answered this question in a conversation:

Healthy discussion po.

HOW DO YOU PLAN TO ACHIEVE YOUR FINANCIAL GOALS such as owning a business, travel the world, own house and lot, etc. ?

Let's skip the "obvious" part of the books such as 
1. Live below your means
2. Start a business
3. Enter real estate
4. Stock market

I mean, how do you plan to get the money as your CAPITAL to enter the said businesses when you are

A. Breadwinner
B. No equipment such as laptop to do online freelancing and the likes
C. Not enough time for free lancing as you work full time
D. Not getting enough support from your environment etc.

Here's my answer:

HOW TO ACHIEVE FINANCIAL GOALS WHILE FACING OBSTACLES.

You have asked a bunch of different financial goals.

You mentioned owning a business.

You mentioned traveling the world.

You mentioned buying a house and lot.

The fact that you put etc means you want more.

The first step is to identify what you want to accomplish.

What's the first order of business for you?

Do you want a business or a house?

Do you want to travel or the house?

What's the priority of your goals?

What are the specifics for your goals?

Define exactly what you want and determine the cost of acquisition.

For example:

What kind of house do you want?

How big do you want your house to be?

How much would you like to spend? 

What are the ameneties?

What's the location?

What are the dealbreakers?

What are the nice to haves?

What activities will you do once you have your house?

These questions and the answers that you'll come up with needs to be written down.

Next. 

What's the order of priority?

If your goal is world travel, there's a good chance you can cancel buying a house and car because you'll live in an AirBnB, appartment and renting an Uber if you move frequently enough.

Same thing happens when you own a house and car, you're less likely to travel and move around because your resources and attention is connected to your house.

You define the goals.

You decide on the order of priority.

The next step is you need to identify your resources.

You mentioned that you're a breadwinner.

I presume you have a job.

You're complaining on an internet group so I presume you have some form of internet connection.

You can't afford to buy a laptop.

The fact that you're male and you're willing to admit this tells me that shelling out ₱30-50k is out of your reach in the forseeable future.

I don't know your job.

You also mentioned that you don't have enough time to freelance and you're not getting support from your environment.

That's all I have to go with and I empahtize with you.

I was in the exact situation when I was younger.

Let's inspect your resources.

Where does all your money go?

Where does all your time go?

How well are you educated?

Does the level of your education match the level of your intelligence?

What skills do you posess?

How do you spend your time to enjoy yourself?

What activities are you doing to improve your life?

Does your job pay you enough for basic expenses?

Does your job provide you with opportunities to earn more or to learn valuable and marketable skills?

Is your job enjoyable or meaningful?

Do you have an intimate relationship?

Do you have close familial relatioship?

Do you have well-meaning friends who support you?

Same process.

Ask yourself these questions.

Write down your answers.

You'll probably invest ₱200 to buy a nice pen and two notebooks to fill out this info.

What resources do you have?

Your resources can be utilized for income generation, building blocks of time in your schedule, and reducing expenses.

Here are some ideas:

Do you know how to cook?

Can you boil four eggs and try to sell those four boiled eggs at work?

If the answer is yes, I can teach you how to add ₱54k by selling boiled eggs at work.

Do you eat out instead of pack your lunch?

Making your own food can help you save ₱12k-36k a year.

If you packed a couple of extra lunchboxes you can earn another ₱24k a year.

That's just food.

Do you know how to write?

Minimum wage for writers is $1 per 100 words.

You can start a blog to jumpstart your portfolio and offer writing service.

Do you have junk, clutter and unused items at home?

Post your items in FB marketplace.

Do you know how to sell effectively?

Research good items to sell online or your workmates.

What bills can you cut out of your expenses?

The pandemic is an opportunity to ask for a discount. What big expenses can you negotiate?

I convinced my landlord to give me a 40% discount off my rent.

The main idea for these improvements is that you start small.

Maybe the small money that you can make selling eggs, or saving from making your baon can help you afford a laptop.

Just a recap.

1. Define what you want.
2. Decide on the order of priority.
3. Do an inventory of your resources.
4. Direct your resources to small activities that can eventually help you overcome your problem.

I know that my explanation is incomplete.

I had to summarize for brevity.

This process took me about twenty years for me to achieve.

I noticed that I would need to evaluate my strategy everytime I received a ₱5k pay increase.

Sometimes the tipid tips and budget meals can hurt you when you're competing in a higher level.

If there's one advice that I can give you.

Don't be distracted.

There's a lot of people offering you to "invest in this" or "sell this."

Focus on what you can do first.

Take care of yourself.

Get enough sleep.

Eat well.

Exercise.

Top performers take care of themselves.

Seriously doubt people who are offering fast and easy approaches to building wealth lalo na yung mga under 30 na financial advisor kunwari.

Avoid people flaunting wealth and success or anything that triggers your envy.

Stay away from those people.

When you're more educated and more skilled, you'll know what to do.

Don't look for mentors.

Look for peers.

Look for people who are working on the exact same things that you're working on.

Look for friends who just bought a computer or started selling products or services online.

Buy them dinner or Starbucks and ask them questions.

Avoid working under these people or asking for a job.

Chances are new employers are often horrible bosses.

Just try to receive advice.

Carefully consider the advice.

Watch out for red flags like when the conversation goes to "selling you a dream" or "getting rich quick."

Let me know if you have questions.
