I responded to a question about how to invest one thousand pesos.

Here's my advice.

Spend ₱500 on a nice second-hand cook book from Booksale or Books for Less.

Browse the book before buying.

I don't mind you spending ₱1,000 on that book.

Learn how to cook.

## Sell eggs at work.

Boil eggs in a large batch and bring two dozen eggs at work.

You'll have ₱60,000 at the end of the year.

## Sell sandwiches at work.

Sandwiches are inexpensive.

You can sell sandwiches for ₱30 to ₱60.

Inexpensive sandwiches are egg and cheese, ham and cheese, or egg mayo.

Premium sandwiches include: egg and bacon, or saussage.

## Sell pasta at work.

You can make a large batch of pasta and sauce.

Pasta sells at a premium.

## Sell salad at work.

Salads are easy to assemble.

You just need to toss the ingredients together with the dressing.

You can sell salad at a premium.

## Expected work and profit

You can double your money every time you bring a batch of food to sell.

A large batch of eggs only require 15 minutes of cook time.

Sandwiches are easy to assemble.

Pasta can be prepared in large batches.

Salad can be sold at a premium.

You can earn ₱60,000-₱200,000 selling food on top of your job.

## Conservative Investment

Worst case scenario is you save ₱3,000 a month by preparing your own meals.

You get to save ₱36,000 a year.

You'll have ₱180,000 after 5 years.

You've built up ₱360,000 after 10 years.

Give me a better investment that that.

Networkers and MLM people will take your ₱1,000 and return zero.

You'll just get overpriced soap and vitamins in return for your money.

Compared to knowledge, every other popular recommendation is a shit investment.

Invest in yourself.

Invest in knowledge.

Ignorance attracts scammers.
