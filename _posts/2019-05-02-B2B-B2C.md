## B2B

Business to business means your work involves offering or servicing other businesses as a primary activity.

You are often talking to business owners or employees of other companies.

## B2C

Business to customer means your work involves offering or servicing customers or your company or client’s company as your primary activity.

You are talking directly to the customers.

## WHICH IS BETTER?

It depends.

B2B is often more predictable but requires a higher skill level as far as English, communication skills, and professionalism goes.

## WHAT SHOULD I CHOOSE?

If I’m new, I usually take the first good offer.

I then re-invest my income into building my skills so I can qualify for more difficult and higher-paying jobs.
