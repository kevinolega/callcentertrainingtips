Two lessons that changed your life.

**Lesson One**

"Your results in life are the average of the top five people that you spend the most of your time with."

**Lesson Two**

If you want to be wealthy, study wealth.
If you want to be healthy, study health.
If you want to be happy, study happiness.
If you want to be successful, study success.
If you want to be a failure, don't study.

Success is a study.

You become what you study.

**What next?**

That said, what do you do if you don't have rich or successful, or happy or healthy or smart people to learn from?

You find them.

I look up to people who are smarter than me.

Many of them continue to study and learn new things long after they are successful at what they set out to do.

I try to learn from them whenever I can.

[Check out this article by James Altucher on what he feels had helped get him the success he wanted in life](https://jamesaltucher.com/2018/03/ten-things-given-success/).

Wouldn't you want to be as smart as that?

**Books, Audiobooks and Podcasts are great tools**

The second best thing is influence.

You can read a smart person's book.

Many people enjoy reading.

I do too.

But sometimes, the available time to sit down and enjoy a book is limited.

Audiobooks are a good alternate but many of the good ones are expensive.

Podcasts are a good alternate.

The best thing about podcasts is that podcasts are free.

Here's a list of podcasts that I listen to.


### Make you smarter

**Let's Know Things**

Let's know things is hosted by Colin Wright. 

He talks about a wide range of topics. 

My favorites include technology, automation and some news. 

Colin is a great story teller. 

Expect to pick up inspiration on analogies, story telling, making a case and your communication skills in general. 

This is my favorite podcast and I've listened to every episode.
