This post was originally received in 11/11/12 and is considered as my first major victory from my website.

Hi guys, first of all I want to say thanks to Kevin Olega who started this blog https://callcentertrainingtips.com, it’s been 3 months since I started reading his posts, and it was really a great help.

## My Background

Back then, I was still working as a waiter in a 5 star hotel in Malate. 

I was happy with my job.

However, I started to realize that my salary is not enough. 

## Why I want to work in a call center...

I'm the breadwinner. 

And my salary is really not enough to support our needs, so I thought of working in a call center.

I heard rumors that the call center industry has many benefits.

And most importantly… they compensate high.

## My first attempt to apply...

First, I started to apply in a career hub in Sta. Mesa. 

At first, I was so nervous. 

I’m a friendly person, so I started to talk with the other applicants to get rid of the nerve tattering time while waiting for my name to be called.

Finally, my name was called. 

It was a panel interview, and I’m not confident with my English communication skills.

Waaaaaahhhh! 

Then my name was called again. 

I stood up, smiling with the interviewer. 

Then the interviewer smiled back at me and said hi.

Then some introductions and then he started to ask me  “TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR SELF” and then I answered... 

## I coudldn't express myself in English...

I’m uhmmmm, name I’m uhmmmmm, location. 

It sounded like I am not sure what I was saying, ahahaha.

In short it was like a disaster, and then the interviewer asked me again, “what are my strengths and weaknesses?”

### I didn't have enough confidence to speak... 

My body froze in front of the other applicants. 

It was like I was being tortured. 

I wanted to walk out. 

It felt like I wanted to be invisible for a while. 

Then the interviewer repeated the question. 

WOAH! 

Then the disaster came true. 

In the end, I was not qualified. 

## The interviewer gave me advice on how to improve...

The comments are: 

I didn’t sound confident. 

I need to improve my English communication skills. 

And so forth.

I just said thanks to the interviewer.

## What I learned about myself... 

I didn’t take it personally…

I was thinking on my way home. 

I know why I was not qualified. 

Basically I don’t know what to say. 

I thought that speaking with those foreigners at the hotel for 2 years made me an average speaker. 

But I was wrong. 

I started to lose confidence with myself ☹ 

## I gave up...

Then I decided to stop trying my luck in the call center industry. 

Then one night, while reading some posts in a forum where I’m a member, I suddenly thought of searching for something that can give me techniques on how to improve my English communication skills. 

Then I searched on Google. 

## How I found Kevin and what I learned...

I started typing words related to the topic, and then I found Call Center Training Tips. 

I started reading the topic about ”Call Center Interview Questions and Suggested Answers” 

Then I got interested in the topic. 

I started to think of the questions the interviewer asked me. 

Then I realized I was not ready to apply. 

I should not be discouraged with what happened with my 1st try.

I started to read topics.

I read about how to introduce myself. 

I also edited my resume just what Mr. Kevin said. 

I followed the tips, like practice speaking, writing and watching English movies and learning the American accent, it was fun for me. 

I ended my contract last August so I stayed at home for 3 weeks reading topics, taking notes and watching English movies on my free time.

## I reached out to Kevin... 

I contacted Kevin Olega and inquired about the training he’s conducting. 

Kevin scheduled me for a training session, my schedule of training is Sunday. 

We were supposed  to meet in a mall, it was Thursday, and then suddenly I received a call from a call center in Boni avenue.

## I got my second chance...

I was invited for an initial interview.

I was confident and a bit nervous with the call. 

Then I decided to go since my training with Mr. Kevin is still on Sunday. 

I went to the interview, I passed the initial interview but then again while on the panel interview I started to get nervous again. 

## The fear came back...

OMG! 

What’s going on? 

And then everything that I learned from the site was gone... 

My confidence started to fade away, I was in the state of shock again :D

In the end, I failed again. 

I was frustrated. 

The only thing that I was thinking is... 

“what’s wrong with me?” 

Am I stupid for not passing that panel interview? 

My mind was floating. 

It was still early that day. 

## I decided to keep going...

Then on my way home I thought of riding a bus instead of riding the MRT. 

On my way down the MRT station, there’s this girl who gave me a flyer about a job hiring. 

I was down that day, then the girl told me that, if I join the interview, even if I don’t pass I will get a free lunch. 

Hehehe! 

“Hey! That’s free lunch!” 

I’m jobless! 

I still have plenty of time to spare. 

Then I tried again that day. 

The interview was conducted in a fast food near the MRT station. 

I passed the initial interview again. 

I received my free lunch! 

I was celebrating!

It was good!

## I got more help from Kevin's lessons...

Then I started to read topics again in the website using my phone while on our way to the call center located at Quezon Avenue. 

Then I was waiting again for my name to be called for the panel interview. 

And the lessons that I read at the website was still fresh. 

The things to remember about introducing myself. 

And how I should pronounce words. 

Then I was surprised that I passed! 

Then another interview and I started to regain confidence. 

I took the exam, and at last, it at 12am, I was in the final interview. 

One on one with one of the account manager, 

I showcased my strengths. 

## What the interviewer said about me...

Then at last... 

I passed, 

Three weeks of preparation, reading, writing, speaking, watching  movies during my break. 

I was so happy! 

Then morning the next day, I signed a contract. 

I started to get busy. 

I processed my requirements. 

I started with the training…

## Thank you Kevin...

Thanks to the website and Kevin Olega! 

I am now working in a call center, earning money, and building my career…

Sir thanks for everything, you were really a great help. 

I will not forget the things that I have learned from you and your blog. 

I wish you and your website more power.

Continue helping people.

God bless you.
