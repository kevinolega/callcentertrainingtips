Let's use this example.

You have a job as a call center agent, and you earn Php 25,000 a month.

You get paid Php 150 per hour.

If you work for a reputable call center and you're handling large accounts, an opening to participate in overtime work is almost always available.

If you spend an extra two hours working, you made and additional Php 300 per day.

If you worked overtime every other day, you would take home and extra Php 3,000 a month.

If you worked overtime every day, you would take home and extra Php 6,000 a month.

One whole workday pays you Php 1,250 a day.

If you spend two hours a day sitting in traffic, you are losing Php 6,000 per month.

If you are playing Mobile Legends or watching YouTube videos, one hour a day, you just put Php 3,000 a month into the garbage.

If you play games or videos two hours a day, that Php 6,000 that you wish you had, went to the game.

If you're a hardcore gamer who plays four hours a day every day, that's Php 12,000 a month in the pockets of the big company that created that game you are playing.

If you spend the whole day with people who don't contribute to your life, you just threw out Php 1,250.

I used to avoid riding the tricycle because I would spend Php 20 for a five -minute ride home.

I didn't realize that the twenty minutes walking costs me Php 30 pesos of my time. 

I also wore my shoes down faster and will need to buy a new pair.

I used to spend hours trying to find free information on the internet about a skill that I want to learn.

I could have bought a book for Php 500 or spent a maximum of Php 3,000 pesos.

I could have paid for a Php 5,000 to Php 20,000 for an online course.

I didn't realize that free options often cost more.

Because every hour that I waste, I bleed Php 150.

If you're qualified for call center work and you're not employed, you are losing Php 1,250 a day or more.

If you're only qualified for minimum wage and you have no job, you are losing Php 537 a day.

How much money have you lost because you decided to waste your time?
