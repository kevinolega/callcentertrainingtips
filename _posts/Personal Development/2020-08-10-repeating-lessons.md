The most dangerous words a person can say is, "I know that already."

When you say that, your brain shuts off its ability to learn.

During a coaching session, I hear a different set of words.

I think I already read that lesson.

Every now and then, a student interrupts me and tells me these words.

The more important question is, are you already benefiting from this lesson?

Sure.

You know the lesson.

You have read it or heard of it.

Have you applied the lesson to your life?

Have you mastered the skill?

Have you gained an advantage in your life from this lesson?

Have you made a profit from the lesson?

If you're not gaining from a lesson, you only know the lesson in theory but have not experienced applying the lesson in practice.
