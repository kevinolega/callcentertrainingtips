Here's what I happens when I use the walk in application strategy.

### How To Get Companies to go to.

I ask people that I know.

Even if I only get the name and location of one company, I'll go there. 

I ask the building's guard and reception if there are other call center companies with job openings in the building.

I'll be friendly with other people in the waiting area and ask them where they've been to and where they plan to go next.

I list down all the company names and locations on my notebook.

### Walk-in strategy

If I go to two companies a day, I expect to visit ten companies in my first week.

On my second week, I already visited twenty companies.

If you have twenty interviews, you can expect the following results:

Five you visit companies hate you and won't hire you.

You'd hate working for five of the companies that you visited.

Five companies love you and you'd love working there.

I go to sixteen interviews before I find the company that I want to work for.
