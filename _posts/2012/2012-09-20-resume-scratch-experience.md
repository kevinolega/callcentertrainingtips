Since I get a lot of questions on how to build a resume from scratch I created a [sample resume that you can use for your call center application <](https://www.evernote.com/l/AI5b2_jFRg5BYbHXWJkLvs5STS9EjsNbh2o).

I also added comments to each part so be sure to read my notes.

Here are a few rules I applied to writing my Call Center resume.

### RESUME WRITING RULES

The font is Arial.

The font size for my name is 24.

The font size for the title text is 16.

The font size for everything eles is 11.

I keep the resume minimal details.

I do my best to eliminate unnecessary details.

### ONE PAGE OR TWO PAGE RESUME

A one-page resume is ideal.

I do my best to stick to a one-resume format.

I relized that a one-page resume only applies if you have some decent work experience.

A one-page resume only works if you don't have job-hopping history or long periods of unemployment in your recent history.

I also realized that I prefered a single page resume because one resume costs less to print.

When I was starting out, I used a two-page resume.

### REMOVE THE OBJECTIVE

I didn’t include an objective because it’s obvious that you are looking for a job.

I also didn’t include a summary because I don’t have a lot of things to put in my resume and I don’t need to summarize for my application as a call center agent.

### IMPORTANT DETAILS IN A CALL CENTER RESUME

Here are some of the details I included. 

Do your best to stick to one page. 

Feel free to NOT include any of the optional details.

Many of the optional details are just used as fillers.

1.  Full Name
2.  Mobile Number
3.  Landline (if any)
4.  Email Address - Please use a professional email address.
5.  Physical Address or Home Address.
6.  Work Experience if any - Summer jobs and part-time jobs also apply. You may also include Freelance and Volunteer work.
7.  Education - College only but if you need fillers feel free to add high school.
8.  Trainings and Seminars
9.  Extra-Curricular Activities
10.  Skills and Interests - I normally don’t include this these days but if you need a filler this works too.
11.  Software - Include work-related software like MS, Apple or Google Documents, Spreadsheets and Presentations. Photoshop. Wordpress or other tools will be useful.
12.  Reference - I don’t include this but if you need a filler this works just fine.

#### Elements I add to the resume to increase the length.

I’d like to stick to the one-page resume rule but my resume should not be less than 3/4th of the page so I include the following fillers.

1.  Software
2.  Trainings and Seminars attended
3.  Reference

So there you have it. 

I hope this short guide helps you get hired in a call center. 

Let me know how resume writing is working out for you.
