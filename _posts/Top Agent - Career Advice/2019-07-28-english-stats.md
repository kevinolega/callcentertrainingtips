Poor CSAT scores and Sales Scores are big reasons why a call center agent gets terminated.

The problem with many Filipino call center agents is that when they pass the interview, they think that it's a good reason for them to STOP practicing their English skills.

What you don't realize is that English skills have a GIANT impact on your sales skills. 

You're not going to trust an ASIAN salesman with your credit card information.

Americans deal with hackers and identity theft on a regular basis.

So they're not going to trust you with financial information if they think you're talking to them from a random city from God knows where.

Now that I've given it more thought, if you have poor Sales and Customer Service Survey score, you're probably saying a lot of things wrong.

Many Filipino employers and Team Leaders are former agents so they're usually embarassed to tell you the problem to your face.

If you have poor sales.

If customers are angry and get angrier after they talk to you.

You probably have really bad English.

Your English are probably Fails in Basic English.

That's why they didn't bother to tell you.

Racism is not accepted. 

But I'll be a 100% racist if it has something to do with my wallet.

And I'm pretty sure you are too.

Here in Manila, if you're in a Starbucks and somebody passes by who looks scruffy, you'll instinctively put your hand over your bag, phone and wallet.

That's the same response when you hear someone who is speaking with bad English.

People only want to deal with success.

And avoid failures most of the time.

If your English is bad...

You need to keep practicing buddy.

Sorry, I let you off there.

But this is the truth if you want to survive in the industry.

Anybody who tells you otherwise is a low performer or somebody who is gambling their career to the mercy of an employer.

Problem with that approach is that sooner or later, patience will run out.

And you'll be out of the job again.
