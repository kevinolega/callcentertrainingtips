## MEDITATION

Meditation has been helpful in handling stress, controling my emotions, and staying focused.

If you don't know how to meditate, you can learn for free on the Headspace website.

You can also download an app for your phone.

## SOUND GENERATOR

I listen to rainy mood to help me sleep or focus.

The sound of rain is relaxing for me.

I also listen to white noise while I work or try to sleep.

## JOURNALLING

I write about what worries me.

I journal on paper.

Writing with a pen on a notebook has a different effect than typing on a keyboard or touch-screen.

You also do not need to worry about light waking you up.

Write your stray thoughts.

Write your worrys.

Write anything bothering you.

Write things you need to do tomorrow.

Write your plans for this week.

Write questions that you're considering.

Write your prayers.

Write about the outcome that you'd like.

Write about the kind of person that you'd like to be.

## PRAYER

After writing pray about what you've written.

Have an honest discussion with the creator of the universe.

Talk about your plans and worries.

Ask for help.

Ask for wisdom.

Ask for guidance.

Then go back to your notebook and write any new ideas that come to mind.

You can usually leave your worries for tomorrow when you combine writing with prayer.

## STRETCHING

Please Google the following stretches.

"Figure 4 Stretch"

"Child's pose"

"Reclined Twist"

"Windshield Wipers stretch"

Do these stretches if you're having trouble sleeping.

These should help relax your muscles and make you fall asleep faster.
