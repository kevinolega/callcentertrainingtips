A friend sent me a list of questions last year. 

I answered and thought it would be great to answer these again this year to see how much I changed.

I made two sections on this lesson, part one contains only the questions for if you want to answer these questions yourself and part two contains my answers.

**Instructions:**

Please write what comes to your mind as soon as you read the question, no overthinking.

**1.) What do you do for work?**



**2.) Are you happy with work, why or why not?**



**3.) In general, are you happy with the way your life is going right now, why or why not?**



**4.) Can you say you are satisfied with what you have or the way your life is playing out, why or why not?**


**5.) If you can change something in your life, what would it be and why do you want to change it?**



**6.) How do you see yourself in 5 yrs from now?**



**7.) Given a chance, what else would you like to pursue?**



**8.) Any complaints you have in your life right now? Why?**


**9.) If given a choice to restart your life say 10 yrs back, would you? Why?**

End of questionnaire. 

Copy up to here if you'd like to take these questions for a spin. 

Leave a comment with your answers or send me a private message if you'd like to share your answers with me.

## This Section Contains My Answers

**Instructions:**

Please write what comes to your mind as soon as you read the question, no overthinking.

**1.) What do you do for work?**

I'm a Project Manager for a US Based Web Design and Development company as well as a Career Transition Business.

I also work part-time for a local CrossFit gym.

**2.) Are you happy with work, why or why not?**

Yes. 

I'm currently enjoying the life I designed from five years back. 

Same answer as last year. 

However, compared to last year, I am doing better. 

This year's career/work is an upgraded form of my work last year. 

My skills are better, I have more experience and I'm working with a bigger version of last year's opportunity.


**3.) In general, are you happy with the way your life is going right now, why or why not?**

You can't complain given the thought and effort you put in. 

I'm sure 20% of my plans didn't fall through but I got 80% of what I went after and I'd be ungrateful if I bitched about that.

Same answer as last year. 

The funny thing is I have bigger problems this year. 

I lost my previous job in the worst possible way, my Dad died and all the shit that came with it, I lost my income for several months, used up my savings, maxed out my credit cards, and the local collections company decided to get my credit cards canceled, a few months later, my girlfriend's mom was hospitalized for almost three months, I also experienced a recurrence of my depression, despite all this, I'm in the same state. 

I'm just responding to a lot of situations with silence and things turn out well.

**4.) Can you say you are satisfied with what you have or the way your life is playing out, why or why not?**

It's a mix of good and bad but for some reason, I can't put into words, I conclude that everything is perfect the way it is.

Same answer as last year.

Whenever I call upon my logical mind, the conclusion is, I have no right to complain. 

I am reaping what I am sowing. 

I also have blessings that I didn't work for. 

I also have challenges to face that will likely grow me into a better person. 

Challenges develop your problem-solving skills and if you're the type person who is pursuing wealth, health and happiness, problem-solving skills are a key element to the attainment of these pursuits.

**5.) If you can change something in your life, what would it be and why do you want to change it?**

I'd probably kiss more girls on the first date. 

The above line was last years answer.

I'd also become more aggressive and prioritize myself more. 

One problem I've had for a long time is I put myself in a bad spot by prioritizing other people to an extreme level. 

I'm lying low now. 

I only help people closer to my circle and I don't overextend myself. 

I say no every now and then and discovered that people won't hate me for not being able to help. 

People understand. 

When it rains everyone gets wet. 

They have problems. 

I have my problems. 

If my hands are full, I won't help. 

If I have a free hand, I'll offer help. 

That's how things work. 

I still feel guilty whenever I can't because I grew up admiring superheroes but this is a reality.

Those stories are what we aspire to be. 

However, the range of our influence is limited compared to our ideals despite our efforts to expand ourselves.

**6.) How do you see yourself in 5 yrs from now?**

Either dead or struggling to stay alive. 

I don't think I have a different answer for this question this year.

**7.) Given a chance, what else would you like to pursue?**

I'd like to explore acting and video blogging. 

Above line was last year's answer.

I'm doing a little bit more of video blogging since I answered this question last year.

I should do more but I have my hands full at the moment.

**8.) Any complaints you have in your life right now? Why?**

Just some holes in the roof of our living room that we haven't gotten around to fixing. 

Shit! Same answer as last year. 

My younger brother smokes in the house and my mom allows it. 

He is in his stupid post-teenage rebellious phase. 

I hate the smell of smoke since I quit smoking intermittently.

Most of the problems I complained about can be solved by renting an office space or working from a 24 hour Starbucks.

**9.) If given a choice to restart your life say 10 yrs back, would you? Why?**

I'd probably go for it and salvage some relationships and rescue people close to me who recently died.  - Last year's answer.

I have more people I wanted to rescue from death. 

However, death is how people find peace. 

The process of death fuels the growth of the people who are alive.

So I'm 50/50 about stopping people from dying. 

Heck, I look forward to dying. 

I have to admit, I'm afraid to die, I'll probably struggle to survive but I don't cling to life or anything else as much as I did in the past.
