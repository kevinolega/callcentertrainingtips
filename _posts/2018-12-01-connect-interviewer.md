This lesson doesn't have an intro but the tips will help you get hired.

## 1. Do an inventory of topics you enjoy talking about.

Here's mine:

- Martial Arts
- Super Heroes and Anime
- Star Wars
- Cooking
- Business, Sales and Marketing
- Personal Development
- Books
- Movies etc.
- PC and Mobile Games 

I plan out each topic on a notebook and use when appropriate.

## 2. Have a story for each job or school that you went to.

I usually have one success story and a one unforgettable lesson story.

## 3. Sell your skills

Think of a non-related skill that you have and think of a way to reason the skill to convince your interviewer that that skill makes you an awesome call center agent.

Sales experience allows you to explain important details well.

## 4. Don't read everything when applying online.

This allows me to send more job applications and get more interviews.

This also allows me to ask the interviewer questions.

What's a typical workday here?

What do you think are the common traits of people who excel at this job?

What's the number one reason why a person would do poorly at this job?

What are your favorite perks or benefits of working here?

What's the best place to eat here?

Are there any benefits to working here that's not commonly known but you're personally thankful for?
