I use a three leg strategy when looking for work as [I outlined in a recent post](http://callcentertrainingtips.com/3-ways-how-to-get-hired-in-a-call-center/). 

If it were me applying here’s what I’d do. I have done this for different positions in the past and I’m sure it will still work. 

**Day One and Day Two**. 

Print 20-30 copies of my resume. Send out 100-200 online applications per day via Jobstreet and Jobsdb. 

I also ask around for friends on facebook or my recruiter friends via email if they have openings. Schedule interview appointments and walk-in’s 

**Day Three Onward**.

At my level, **it takes me sixteen interviews to find a job at a company that I like that offers me how much I would like to earn**.

Every experience between interview one and interview 16 is a mix of heartbreaking no's and learning experiences. I try to make the most of what I got.

I set myself a rule that I have no right to complain, give up or quit if I attended less than thirty interviews.

I do my best to have 2 or more interviews a day (ideally, one in the morning and one in the afternoon) for a month to get hired as soon as I can.

That's it.

Happy hunting.
