Call center agents are not the true bayaning puyat.

On social media, many call center agents self-identify as “bayaning puyat”

But that is simply not true.

Before call center work became a popular career choice for many Filipinos.

Filipinos already had shift workers who work nights, graveyard shift, works on weekends and holidays.

At the top of my head we have:

- Doctors
- Nurses
- Security guards 
- Toll gate attendants
- 711 cashiers
- Gasoline attendants
- Fast food crew
- Police officers
- Jeepney drivers
- Taxi drivers
- Bus drivers
- Tricycle drivers
- Cigarette vendors
- And many more.

These people, like call center agents are also trying to improve their life.

They are also trying to provide for their family.

They are also trying to claw their way out of poverty.

Call center agents are not the only bayaning puyat.

All Filipino shift workers are.

Maybe it’s about time that we stopped and acknowledged that.

Mabuhay and mangagawang Pilipino.
