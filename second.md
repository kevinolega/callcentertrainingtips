Thank you for completing part one!

Here’s part two.

### The Basics How To Succeed In Life and Call Center Work

To participate in this activity please read the following statements out loud. Let’s begin!

Your mindset will dictate whether you will succeed or fail.

Anything you need to know can be learned.

English is a skill.

People skills are a skill.

Salesmanship is a skill.

Skills can be learned.

Nobody is born with skills.

People who are good at specific skills spend time, practice, made mistakes, learned and got better over time.

The first attempt often looks silly and stupid. 

That is okay.

You get better as you gain more experience.

A player who is at level one and a player who is at level fifty will have different results

That is okay.

For things to change you need to change.

Let me say that again.

For my situation to change, I will need to change.

If I don't change, my situation will stay the same.

People who succeed are positive about finding solutions to their problems.

Negative people are passionate about how impossible it is to find solutions to their problems.

There are only one or two things that I need to work on and all I need to do is to get it right and then repeat the process a few more times and eventually, the habit forms and when I have mastered the skill, my ability to get things done becomes permanent.

The best way to learn is by doing.

Mistakes can be corrected.

A failure is an event not the person.

I can fail many times but I am never a failure.

If I fail, there is something wrong with my technique not with myself.

Technique can be corrected by practicing.

There are people who have done this (my goal) before and if they can do it I can do it too.

God has blessed me with all that I have and the ability to get better every day.

Nothing is instant and everything in nature grow slowly.

There are no shortcuts.

I will continue to work on getting better until I reach my goal.

Luck means preparation meeting opportunity.

I will keep preparing myself so when the opportunity presents itself, I will be ready.

I will give no excuse because an excuse is a lie that I tell myself justify why I did not get what I want.

In the event that I feel or am at a loss what to do next I will always remember that "the answer is always there and I just haven't found it yet."

Knowing this I will continue to search for the answer and I will not stop until I find it.

#### You Don't Need To Wait For Me

I'm honored that people ask me for tips on how to get hired. You actually don't need me to get hired. You don't need to wait for me to teach you. You don't need me to write your resume. You don't need to me to answer your question.

When I was younger I used to believe I need somebody to succeed. At times I would wait for weeks, months, even years to get to convince somebody to help me. Things never turned out as planned.

Got a friend who said he will refer you to their company? You can go directly to the company you want to apply at yourself.

Got a question you're waiting for an answer? Google it or you can find out yourself.

Waiting for a response to an email application? Walk in to other companies randomly.

Didn't know how your interview went? Ask the interviewer where you sucked at and ask for tips. When I got used to this, I asked as much questions as I could, extending my interview time to 30 minutes and sometimes an hour. One time the interviewer decided to recommend me for a job offer after just answering my questions.

The last one took the most courage. It also gave me the ability to go to the next interview more equipped and eventually, more confidently.

Ask your best friend to practice English with you. Tell them to write down every time you made a mistake or said something that didn't make sense. Discuss the alternatives.

It's an honor to be asked all these questions but I'm not always online. I have other things going on in my life. I also have [another blog][7]. I also [travel around][8]. I wrote the tips on this site to answer questions for people so I don't need to answer them one by one per person.

If you're asking for some tips please read my tips first and ask for specifics in case I missed out on some details.

Write your own guide. Borrow from the lessons you picked up from this site.

Don't use lack of something (information or skills) as an excuse for inaction. Instead ask yourself, if I never got (what you are waiting for) what do I do to get what I want?

My answer or whatever you are waiting for won't bring you closer to your goals. Your first steps will. Go ahead and start don't wait for me.
